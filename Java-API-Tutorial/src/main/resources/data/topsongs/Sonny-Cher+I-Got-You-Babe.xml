      <p>"I Got You Babe" is a 1965 number-one hit single by American
    pop music duo Sonny &amp; Cher.</p>
      <p>Sonny Bono, a songwriter and record producer for Phil
    Spector, wrote the song for himself and his wife, Cher, late at
    night in their basement. Noted session drummer Hal Blaine
    performed the drums for the song. Bono was inspired to write
    the song to capitalize on the popularity of the term "babe," as
    heard in Bob Dylan's "It Ain't Me Babe" which was a hit for The
    Turtles.</p>
      <p>Upon recording and releasing the song, "I Got You Babe"
    became the duo's biggest single, their signature song, and a
    defining recording of the early hippie countercultural
    movement. In August 1965, the single spent three weeks at the
    number-one spot on the Billboard Hot 100 and number nineteen on
    the R&amp;B charts in the United States . The duo's single also
    hit number one in the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>The song has been frequently covered and featured in film
    and television, including Sonny and Cher's own 
    <i>The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour</i>. "I Got You Babe" made a
    bit of a comeback when it was heavily featured as Phil Connor's
    alarm clock wake up music in the 1993 movie 
    <i>Groundhog Day</i>. Upon re-release, the single re-charted in
    the UK, reaching #66.</p>
      <p>The song was later covered by Cher in a music video that
    featured Beavis and Butthead as a rapt audience to Cher's
    performance. In the video, the idiot pair refer to her former
    husband Bono as a dork and a wuss, to which Cher agrees.</p>
      <p>Sonny and Cher last performed the song together during an
    impromptu reunion on NBC's 
    <i>Late Night with David Letterman</i>on Nov. 13, 1987. The
    song placed at #444 on 
    <i>Rolling Stone'</i>s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of all
    time.</p>
      <p>Cher performed the song with R.E.M. on February 14, 2002, at
    the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles. It was her first performance
    of the song without Sonny.</p>
