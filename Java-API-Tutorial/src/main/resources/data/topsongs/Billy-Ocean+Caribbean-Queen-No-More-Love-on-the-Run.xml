      <p>"Caribbean Queen" is a song by Billy Ocean. Co-written and
    co-produced by Robert John "Mutt" Lange, it climbed to number
    one on both the soul singles and Hot 100, in the U.S.. and
    number six in the UK in 1984.</p>
      <p>The song was recorded under different titles for different
    parts of the worldâ€”resulting in versions such as "European
    Queen" and "African Queen."</p>
      <p>In 2004, the song was re-released as a digital single for
    its 20th anniversary, shooting up to #25 on the Billboard
    digital singles chart and garnering radio play across the US
    and UK.</p>
      <p>A remix of the single by Will.I.Am was released in 2005, and
    it later appeared on Pitchfork's "Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s"
    countdown, at #87.</p>
