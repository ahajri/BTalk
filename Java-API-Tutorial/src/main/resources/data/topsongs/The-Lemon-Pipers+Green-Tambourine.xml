      <p>"Green Tambourine" was the primary hit by the 1960s
    Ohio-based rock group The Lemon Pipers, as well as the title
    track to their debut-album 
    <i>Green Tambourine</i>. Released towards the end of 1967, it
    peaked at number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 for one week
    at the start of February, 1968 and earned the group a gold
    record for over a million copies sold. The record remained on
    the chart for three months. It was also the first U.S.
    number-one hit for the Buddah label. The Lemon Pipers would
    never repeat this success, although "Rice Is Nice" and "Jelly
    Jungle" did make it onto the charts in 1968.</p>
      <p>The song is the story of a street musician pleading for
    someone to give him money. In exchange, he would play his green
    tambourine. The song's instrumentation contains the title
    tambourine as well as an electric sitar. (Sitar was a frequent
    trademark of the so-called "psychedelic sound".) Another hook
    is the heavy, psychedelic tape echo applied to the word "play"
    in each chorus and at the end, fading into a drumroll ("Listen
    while I play 
    <i>play play play play play</i>/my green tambourine").</p>
      <p>Mrs. Miller covered the song on her 1968 album 
    <i>Mrs. Miller Does Her Thing</i>.</p>
      <p>Status Quo covered the song on their 1968 debut album 
    <i>Picturesque Matchstickable Messages from the Status
    Quo</i>.</p>
      <p>Lawrence Welk covered the song and his version placed on the
    Billboard Easy Listening survey.</p>
      <p>Tripping Daisy covered the song on their 1992 debut album, 
    <i>Bill</i>(The Dragon Street release).</p>
      <p>At the end of the 2001 film 
    <i>Recess: School's Out</i>, TJ and the gang are seen playing
    this song, with Mikey singing vocals (Mikey's singing voice
    provided by Robert Goulet). The gang and Principal Prickly are
    seen in the background, dressed and hairstyled in Sixties
    hippie clothing and/or hair.</p>
