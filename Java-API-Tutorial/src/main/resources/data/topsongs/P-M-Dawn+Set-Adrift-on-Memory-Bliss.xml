   <descr>
      <p>"Set Adrift on Memory Bliss" is the signature hit by P.M.
    Dawn from their debut album, Of the Heart, of the Soul and of
    the Cross: The Utopian Experience. Song writing credit is given
    to Attrell Cordes (Prince Be of P.M. Dawn) and Gary Kemp of
    Spandau Ballet as the song is built around samples of their
    1983 hit "True", as well as samples from The Soul Searchers'
    "Ashley's Roachclip." Spandau Ballet lead singer Tony Hadley
    made a cameo in the video to this song; appearing near the end
    of the video.</p>
      <p>This song was the group's first (and only) #1 hit on the Hot
    100, and also reached #3 on the UK Singles Chart. It ranks #81
    on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop. The song was the first
    number one song after the debut of the Nielsen SoundScan
    system, which monitored airplay and sales more closely than
    before when 
    <i>Billboard</i>had to rely on humans to report sales and
    airplay data. According to the test charts of the SoundScan
    system, "Set Adrift on Memory Bliss" was at number one for at
    least three weeks, but officially has a one-week reign at
    number one.</p>
      <p>The opening verse is influenced by the Joni Mitchell song
    "The Boho Dance". The original "A camera pans the cocktail
    hour/ Behind a blind of potted palms" becomes "The camera pans
    the cocktail glass/ Behind a blind of plastic plants", and the
    line "Subterranean by your own design" is echoed as
    "Subterranean by design". In the second verse, they mention two
    hit songs from 1985. "Careless whisper from a careless man"
    refers to "Careless Whisper" by George Michael, and "A neutron
    dance for a neutron fan" makes reference to "Neutron Dance" by
    The Pointer Sisters. The line 
    <i>"Christina Applegate, you gotta put me on"</i>is a reference
    to the song "Bonita Applebum" by A Tribe Called Quest.</p>
