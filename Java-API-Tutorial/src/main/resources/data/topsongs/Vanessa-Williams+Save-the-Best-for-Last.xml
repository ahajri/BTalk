      <p>"Save the Best for Last" is a 1992 song written by Phil
    Galdston, Wendy Waldman and Jon Lind. It is considered Vanessa
    Williams' signature song. The lyrics' redemptive themes
    resonated with Williams' story, as she had put together a
    successful recording career following her earlier Miss America
    resignation scandal. The song is about a person who stands by
    and watches as the object of his/her desires dates all of these
    different women, and then he finally decides to consummate a
    relationship with the singer.</p>
      <p>The single was Williams' third number one on the Soul
    singles chart and topped the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 for five
    weeks in 1992. "Save the Best for Last" was ranked fourth in
    the Billboard Top 100 hits of 1992, becoming the biggest
    success of Williams' music career. The song also went to #1 on
    the U.S. adult contemporary and R&amp;B charts; it remained
    atop these charts for three weeks apiece. Internationally, the
    single shot to number one in Australia, the Netherlands, and
    Canada, and to number three in the United Kingdom, number two
    in Ireland, and number three in Japan. ASCAP named it as its
    Song of the Year, meaning it was performed more than any other
    song in 1992, and it was nominated for the Grammy Award for
    Song of the Year and Record of the Year in 1993.</p>
      <p>There are two versions of the music video for this single.
    Along with the original version, the song was reworked and
    re-released as a Christmas single in 1993. It recharted for
    several years as a holiday favorite, with a new snowy videoclip
    version played on MTV.</p>
