      <p>"Half-Breed" is a song recorded by Cher and released as a
    single in 1973. On October 6, 1973, it became Cher's second
    U.S. number one hit as a solo artist.</p>
      <p>The single was the first international release from Cher's
    album 
    <i>Half-Breed</i>. The song tells the story of a young woman
    who is half white and half Cherokee. The song describes the
    troubles she faced, and the racism she experienced. White
    people often called her "Indian squaw" and the Native Americans
    never accepted her as one of their own, telling her that she
    was "white by law." Cher herself is part Cherokee.</p>
      <p>In 1973, "Half-Breed" topped the United States Billboard Hot
    100 for two weeks, becoming Cher's second number one hit and
    second Gold single. The song was a number one hit in Canada, a
    Top 10 hit in Sweden, and a Top 20 hit in Norway. In Germany
    and the United Kingdom, the song did not chart.</p>
      <p>In 1999, after almost 25 years of not performing the song
    live, Cher performed this song in her Do You Believe? Tour. In
    2002, she performed the song 325 times in her Living Proof: The
    Farewell Tour.</p>
      <p>Cher performed the song on the following concert tours:</p>
      <p>The video for "Half-Breed" is a recorded performance of the
    song on 
    <i>The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour</i>in 1973. Cher is on a
    horse while singing in front of a white screen. Props
    symbolizing Native American objects were used, such as wood
    carvings, fire and costumes.</p>
      <p>In 2002, a special remix medley was created by Dan-O-Rama
    for a video montage that was used in Cher's Living Proof: The
    Farewell Tour. The medley contains the videos of "All I Really
    Want to Do", "Gypsys, Tramps &amp; Thieves", "Half-Breed" and
    "Dark Lady".</p>
