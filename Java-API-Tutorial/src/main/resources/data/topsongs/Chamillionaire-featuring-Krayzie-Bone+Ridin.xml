      <p>"Ridin'" (or Ridin' Dirty) is the second single from
    Chamillionaire's album, 
    <i>The Sound of Revenge</i>, and features a guest rap by
    Krayzie Bone. Its title is often incorrectly assumed to be
    "Ridin' Dirty" due to the chorus. The lyrics concern racial
    profiling and police brutality, as well as the stereotyping of
    African Americans driving a vehicle with drugs or other
    contraband on the inside ("riding dirty"). The music video
    attempts to create a sense of the police abusing their powers
    for likely racist reasons, though the singer does admit to
    various crimes of that nature, including driving under the
    influence, juxtaposing police actions with wrestling scenes to
    show how the police allegedly treat suspects. The music video,
    filmed in Dallas, Texas, also has cameo appearances by Tom
    Lister Jr., Wish Bone, Layzie Bone, Play-N-Skillz, Chingo
    Bling, OG Ron C, Big Tuck, and Chamillionaire's younger brother
    Rasaq.</p>

         <i>Ridin'</i>was awarded "Best Rap Performance by a Duo or
    Group" at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards. It was also nominated
    for Best Rap Song. It became number one in December on the
    Piczo Chart 3 months after its physical release. The song also
    topped the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. for two weeks, and
    peaked at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart behind Shakira when
    it was released there.</p>
      <p>The song ranked #3 on 
    <i>Rolling Stone's</i>"100 Best Songs of 2006". It was the best
    selling ringtone in 2006, with 3.2 million sales, certified by
    the RIAA as the first multi-platinum Mastertone artist in
    history.</p>
      <p>Number 91 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop. It was
    also awarded the last Best Rap Video at the MTV Video Music
    Awards, which was awarded in 2006.</p>
