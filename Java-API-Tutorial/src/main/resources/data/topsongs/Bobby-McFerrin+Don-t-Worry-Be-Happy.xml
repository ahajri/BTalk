      <p>"Don't Worry, Be Happy" is the title and principal lyric of
    a song by musician Bobby McFerrin. Released in September 1988,
    it became the first a cappella song to reach number one on the
    Billboard Hot 100 chart, a position it held for two weeks. On
    the UK Singles Chart, the song reached number 2 during its
    fifth week on the chart. At the 1989 Grammy Awards, "Don't
    Worry Be Happy" won the awards for Song of the Year, Record of
    the Year, and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. The song's title
    is taken from a famous quote by Meher Baba. The original music
    video stars Robin Williams and Bill Irwin. The "instruments" in
    the 
    <i>a cappella</i>song are entirely overdubbed voice parts and
    other sounds made by McFerrin, using no instruments at all. The
    music video for the song is considerably shorter than the album
    version.</p>
      <p>It is ranked #31 on VH1's 
    <i>100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of the 80s</i>.</p>
      <p>The Indian mystic and sage Meher Baba (1894–1969) often used
    the expression "Don't worry, be happy" when cabling his
    followers in the West. However, Meher Baba communicated
    variations of the sentiment; fuller versions of the quote—such
    as, "
    <i>Do your best. Then, don’t worry; be happy in My love. I will
    help you</i>" -- also incorporate responsibility ("do your
    best...") alongside the detachment ("don't worry..."), as well
    as the master/disciple spiritual relationship ("I will help
    you"). In the 1960s, the truncated version of this expression
    by Baba was printed up on inspiration cards and posters of the
    era. In 1988, McFerrin noticed a similar poster in the
    apartment of the jazz band Tuck &amp; Patti in San Francisco.
    Inspired by the expression's charm and simplicity, McFerrin
    wrote the now famous song, which was included in the soundtrack
    of the movie 
    <i>Cocktail</i>, and became a hit single the next year. In an
    interview by Bruce Fessier for 
    <i>USA Weekend Magazine</i>in 1988 McFerrin said, "Whenever you
    see a poster of Meher Baba, it usually says 'Don't worry, be
    happy,' which is a pretty neat philosophy in four words, I
    think."</p>
      <p>Versions of "Don't Worry, Be Happy" have been recorded by
    several artists. The Katsimiha Brothers made a Greek cover of
    the song with original lyrics, and Montenegrin musician Rambo
    Amadeus made a parody entitled "Don't Happy, Be Worry," as a
    critique to the optimism of the music scene in the former
    Yugoslavia in the face of war and economic depression. The
    lyrics of "Fight the Power" by hip-hop artists Public Enemy
    also refer to "Don't Worry, Be Happy". This song is also added
    into the Big Mouth Billy Bass. Hermes House Band covered the
    song on their "Rhythm of the Nineties" album in 2009. Reggae
    artist Cas Haley covered the song as a hidden bonus track on
    his "Favorites" album (together with former Jah Roots lead
    singer, Josh Heinrichs).</p>
      <p>The song, and its title are commonly repeated in US culture.
    Comedian George Carlin wrote in 
    <i>Napalm and Silly Putty</i>that many Americans would embrace
    the philosophy of denial in the song. The song was used in
    George H. W. Bush's 1988 U.S. presidential election campaign
    until McFerrin, who was a Democrat, objected and the campaign
    desisted. The song is frequently used in film and television
    soundtracks to accompany light-hearted scenes, such as in 
    <i>Flushed Away</i>(2006), 
    <i>WALL-E</i>(2008), 
    <i>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</i>, 
    <i>The Simpsons</i>, 
    <i>Futurama</i>, 
    <i>Nip/Tuck</i>and 
    <i>That 70s Show</i>. It was also featured in the soundtrack to
    1988 film Cocktail. It has also been used in an ironic context
    for shocking or traumatic scenes, such as in 
    <i>Dawn of the Dead</i>(2004) and 
    <i>Jarhead</i>(2005). The song has been used in various forms
    in TV advertising for brands including Alamo Rent A Car,
    Walkers and Huggies.</p>
      <p>Originally released in conjunction with the film 
    <i>Cocktail</i>in 1988, the song originally peaked at #88 on
    the Billboard Hot 100. The song was re-released the same year
    and peaked at #1 on September 24, 1988. The song also peaked at
    #11 on the Billboard Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Tracks chart and #7 on
    the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart. The song was
    also a hit in the United Kingdom and peaked at #2 on the UK
    Singles Chart.</p>
