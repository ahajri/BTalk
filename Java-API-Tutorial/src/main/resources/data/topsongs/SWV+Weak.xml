      <p>"Weak" is an R&amp;B ballad recorded by the girl group SWV
    for their debut album, 
    <i>It's About Time</i>(1992). It was written and produced by
    Brian Alexander Morgan, who composed the lyrics based upon his
    feelings towards R&amp;B singer Chant√© Moore.</p>
      <p>The song was released as the third single from SWV's album,
    following the top-ten success of "I'm So Into You". "Weak" hit
    number one on the U.S. Hot 100 in July 1993 for two weeks, and
    is one of SWV's biggest hits. It also topped the Hot R&amp;B
    Singles chart for two weeks. Teen singer JoJo covered "Weak" in
    2004 on her self-titled debut album.</p>
      <p>At seven, "Weak" set a record for the fewest number of
    characters needed to make up a title and artist's name on an
    American number-one single.</p>
