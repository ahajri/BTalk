      <p>"Incense and Peppermints" is a song by the Los Angeles based
    psychedelic pop band Strawberry Alarm Clock. It was released as
    a single during 1967 by UNI Records and reached the #1 position
    on the Hot 100, where it stayed for one week before beginning
    its fall down the charts. Although the single was released in
    the United Kingdom it failed to break into the UK Singles
    Chart.</p>
      <p>Prior to the release of "Incense and Peppermints", the
    Strawberry Alarm Clock had already issued three singles, "My
    Flash on You" b/w "Fortune Teller", "In the Building" b/w "Hey
    Joe", and "Heart Full Of Rain" b/w "Next Plane Home", on
    All-American Records under the name Thee Sixpence. During
    recording sessions for "Incense and Peppermints", the band
    expressed a dislike for the song's lyrics (written by John
    Carter), so the lead vocals were sung by Greg Munford (a friend
    of the band) who was attending the recording session as a
    visitor. The regular vocalists in the band were relegated to
    providing background and harmony vocals on the record.
    Controversially, band members Mark Weitz and Ed King were both
    denied songwriting credits by the band's producer, Frank Slay,
    despite the fact that the song was, at least partially, built
    on an instrumental idea by Weitz and King. King would go on to
    greater fame as a member of the 1970s Southern rock band Lynyrd
    Skynyrd.</p>
      <p>"Incense and Peppermints" initially appeared on the B-side
    of Thee Sixpence's fourth single, "The Birdman of Alkatrash",
    released on All-American Records in April 1967. However, local
    radio stations began playing "Incense and Peppermints" (the
    single's B-side) instead of the A-side and the song began to
    gain in popularity in and around Los Angeles. Sensing the
    possibility of a national hit, UNI Records (a subsidiary of
    MCA) picked up the record for national distribution and the
    single was re-released; this time with "Incense and
    Peppermints" on the A-side and "The Birdman of Alkatrash" as
    the B-side. By the time of this second pressing, the band had
    changed their name to Strawberry Alarm Clock due to the
    existence of a local group with a name somewhat similar to Thee
    Sixpence.</p>
      <p>"Incense and Peppermints" spent a total of 16 weeks on the
    chart, finally reaching the #1 spot on November 25, 1967. The
    single eventually earned a gold disc from the RIAA on 19
    December 1967 for sales of one million copies.</p>
