      <p>"Venus" is the name of a song written by Ed Marshall and
    Peter DeAngelis. The most successful and well-known recording
    of it was done by Frankie Avalon and released in 1959 (see 1959
    in music). It became Avalon's first number-one hit on the
    Billboard Hot 100 chart, where it spent five weeks atop the
    survey; the song also reached #10 on the R&amp;B chart. The
    song's lyrics detail a man's plea to Venus, the Roman goddess
    of love and beauty, to send him a girl to love and one who will
    love him as well.</p>
      <p>The song was covered in the United Kingdom by Dickie
    Valentine who spent seven days at No 20 in the Singles Chart in
    May 1959 the week before Frankie Avalon reached the Top 20 with
    his original version.</p>
      <p>In 1976, Avalon released a new disco version of "Venus".
    This helped revive the singer's career, as his success had been
    waning prior to its release. The re-recording of "Venus" was
    Avalon's last Hot 100 hit, peaking at #46. It did, however,
    reach #1 on the adult contemporary chart. Avalon was quoted
    describing the remake: "It was all right, but I still prefer
    the original."</p>
      <p>Barry Manilow covered the song in 2006 on his album 
    <i>The Greatest Songs of the Fifties</i>. Johnny Mathis also
    released a cover version of the song and, although it failed to
    reach the Hot 100, it "bubbled under" the chart at #111 in
    1968. On April 8, 2009, Avalon sang "Venus" live on American
    Idol's top 8 show in a tribute to Simon Cowell's 1959 birth
    year.</p>
