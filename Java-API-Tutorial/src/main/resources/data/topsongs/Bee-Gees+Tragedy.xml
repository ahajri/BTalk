      <p>"Tragedy" is a song recorded by the Bee Gees, included on
    their 1979 album 
    <i>Spirits Having Flown</i>. The single reached number one in
    the UK in February 1979 and repeated the feat the following
    month on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. Though not originally in 
    <i>Saturday Night Fever</i>, it has subsequently been added to
    the musical score of the West End version of the
    movie-musical.</p>
      <p>The song knocked "I Will Survive" by Gloria Gaynor off the
    top spot in the U.S. for two weeks before that song again
    returned to number one for an additional week.</p>
      <p>In 1979, NBC aired 
    <i>The Bee Gees Special</i>which showed how the sound effect
    for the explosion was created. Barry cupped his hands over a
    microphone and made an exploding sound. Several of these sounds
    were then mixed together creating one large boom heard on the
    record.</p>
      <p>In 1998, Steps covered "Tragedy", releasing it as a double
    A-side with "Heartbeat". It debuted at number two on the UK
    Singles Chart before climbing to the top spot, achieving
    platinum status. A dance step of putting both hands parallel to
    the sides of the head became the trademark move of the British
    group. "Tragedy" has sold more copies than all three previous
    Steps singles combined. It spent eighteen weeks in the Top 20
    and thirty weeks on the chart in total.</p>
