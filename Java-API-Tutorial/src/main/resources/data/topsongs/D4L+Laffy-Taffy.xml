      <p>"Laffy Taffy" is a song by Atlanta-based hip-hop group D4L
    which reached number one on the Hot 100 in January 2006. The
    song's success on the charts was largely due to its enormous
    online sales. Produced by Cory Way p/k/a "Born Immaculate,
    Broderick Thompson Smith and Richard Sims p/k/a "K-Rab". The
    song samples and interpolates elements of "Candy Girl" by New
    Edition.</p>
      <p>There has been some debate regarding the meaning of the
    phrase "Laffy Taffy." Many understand the term to mean a
    woman's labia minora because of its resemblance to "stretched
    out taffy." It is a phrase commonly used by men who attend
    strip clubs. Women with larger labia minora lips are said to
    have "laffy taffy". The song's music video is set in a strip
    club.</p>
      <p>During "The Champ" from 2006's 
    <i>Fishscale</i>, Ghostface Killah asks "Y'all stuck on Laffy
    Taffy/Wonderin' how'd y'all niggas get past me?" Ghostface had
    mocked the "snap dance" during his 2005 tour. There has also
    been controversy on who wrote "Laffy Taffy". Rapper Liam "Smack
    Eyes" Thomas claims that the group had stolen the lyrics from
    his rhyme book.</p>
