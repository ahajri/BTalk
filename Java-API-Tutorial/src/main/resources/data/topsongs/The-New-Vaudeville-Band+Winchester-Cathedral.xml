      <p>"Winchester Cathedral" is a song released in late 1966 by
    Fontana Records, whereupon it shot to the #1 spot on the
    Billboard Hot 100 chart. It was released by The New Vaudeville
    Band, a novelty group established by the song's composer, Geoff
    Stephens. Stephens was a big fan of tunes from the British
    music hall era (or what Americans would call "Vaudeville"), so
    he wrote "Winchester Cathedral" in that vein, complete with a
    Rudy Vall√©e sound-a-like (John Carter) singing through a
    megaphone. Although recorded entirely by session musicians,
    when the song became an international hit, an actual band had
    to be assembled, which toured extensively under the tutelage of
    Peter Grant, who later went on to manage The Yardbirds and Led
    Zeppelin.</p>
      <p>The tune went to number four in the UK Singles Chart. It
    went all the way to the top in the U.S., however, displacing
    "You Keep Me Hangin' On" by the Supremes on December 3, 1966.
    After a one-week run at #1, "Winchester Cathedral" was knocked
    off the summit by the Beach Boys' "Good Vibrations", only to
    rebound to number one the following week. After two additional
    weeks, it was knocked off the top for good by "I'm a Believer"
    by The Monkees.</p>
      <p>"Winchester Cathedral" topped the 
    <i>Billboard</i>"Easy Listening" chart (later re-named the
    Adult Contemporary chart) for four weeks. Cover records by Dana
    Rollin and The New Happiness reached no higher than number
    70.</p>
      <p>The song won the 1966 Grammy Award for 'Best Contemporary
    Rock &amp; Roll Recording'.</p>
