      <p>"Fireflies" is the first single from electronic artist Owl
    City's 
    <i>Ocean Eyes</i>. Relient K vocalist Matt Thiessen is featured
    as a guest vocalist in the song. He described it as "a little
    song about bugs and not being able to fall asleep at night."
    The single has attained worldwide success, topping the charts
    in the United States, Australia, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden,
    Norway, the United Kingdom, India and the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>The music video for "Fireflies" was directed by Steve
    Hoover. It features Adam Young playing the song on his old
    (80's) synthesizer in a toy-filled bedroom, where most of the
    toys (including an astronaut, toy cars, and a blimp) come to
    life. Most of the toys are older model toys, with most of them
    from the 1970s and '80s (an exception being a Robosapien).
    There are also vintage household devices such as an analog
    television and record player. The video had an exclusive
    premiere on MySpace, but was leaked onto Dailymotion some time
    before and YouTube soon after.</p>
      <p>The song debuted on the Hot 100 in early-September at number
    ninety-seven, and it reached number one in its tenth week,
    becoming Owl City's first number-one single. The song stayed at
    number one for two non-consecutive weeks, in the top ten for
    fifteen weeks and on the Hot 100 for twenty-seven weeks so far.
    "Fireflies" contributed to sales of the album 
    <i>Ocean Eyes</i>, and was credited as being responsible for
    its entry to the top ten on the U.S. 200. On the Billboard Hot
    100 2009 year-end chart, it was ranked sixtieth. The RIAA
    certified "Fireflies" double-platinum in January 2010.</p>
      <p>The song entered the UK Singles Chart at number fifty due to
    early download sales from a fake version that got leaked onto
    iTunes. The song would go on to make a forty-eight place jump
    to number two the following week, beaten only to the top by
    "Replay" by Iyaz. The following week, it rose to number one,
    and topped the chart for three consecutive weeks. The BPI
    certified "Fireflies" silver in February 2010</p>
      <p>The song has attained success worldwide. It has reached
    number one in Australia, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden and the
    Netherlands(for 10 weeks) and the top ten in Austria, Belgium,
    Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Japan, New Zealand,
    Norway, Switzerland and the Slovak Republic.</p>
