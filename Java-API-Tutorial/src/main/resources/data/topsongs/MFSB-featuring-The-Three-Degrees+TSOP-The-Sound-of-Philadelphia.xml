      <p>"TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)" is a 1974 hit recording
    by MFSB (Mother, Father, Sister, Brother) featuring vocals by
    The Three Degrees. A classic example of the Philadelphia soul
    genre, it was written by Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff as the
    theme for the American musical television program 
    <i>Soul Train</i>, which specialized in African-American
    musical performers. The single was released on the Philadelphia
    International label.</p>
      <p>The song is essentially an instrumental piece, featuring a
    lush blend of strings and horns in the Philadelphia soul style.
    There are only two vocal parts to the song: a passage close to
    the beginning during which The Three Degrees sing "People all
    over the world!"; and the chorus over the fadeout, "Let's get
    it on/It's time to get down". The words "People all over the
    world!" are not heard in the original version. "TSOP" hit
    number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in the spring of 1974
    and remained there for two weeks. It also topped the American
    R&amp;B chart (for one week) and adult contemporary chart (for
    two weeks). The Three Degrees would revisit the top of the AC
    chart later in 1974 with their hit single, "When Will I See You
    Again".</p>
      <p>Although it was rerecorded a number of times for future
    versions of the show, "TSOP" has remained the theme song for 
    <i>Soul Train</i>through the disco, 1980s R&amp;B, new jack
    swing, hip-hop, and neo soul eras of Black music.</p>
      <p>"TSOP" was covered by Dexys Midnight Runners and released as
    a B-side on the 12" version of the "Jackie Wilson Said" single,
    later issued on the remastered version of the album 
    <i>Too-Rye-Ay</i>. The band also used it to open some of their
    live shows.</p>
      <p>Another cover was made in 1978 by reggae band Inner Circle,
    who had a history of covering American soul songs in the
    laid-back reggae style of the late 1970s.</p>
      <p>The song is played at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia
    prior to every Phillies home game. Pilipinas, Game KNB?, a
    Philippines game show hosted by actor/politician Edu Manzano,
    used an adaptation of TSOP called "Papayo Yowza" as its
    theme.</p>
