      <p>"Hypnotize" is the Grammy-nominated hip-hop song recorded by
    Brooklyn rapper The Notorious B.I.G. It was released as the
    first single from his album 
    <i>Life After Death</i>in April of 1997.</p>
      <p>The song was already a huge hit on U.S. radio stations
    before its release. Once a single was issued, "Hypnotize"
    entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number two, right behind
    labelmate and co-writer/co-producer Puff Daddy ("Can't Nobody
    Hold Me Down"). When "Hypnotize" hit number one the following
    week, it made The Notorious B.I.G. the fifth artist in Hot 100
    history to have a posthumous chart-topper (
    <i>see List of Hot 100 (U.S.) chart achievements and
    trivia</i>). It also gave back-to-back number-one hits to Sean
    Combs' Bad Boy Records label. It was nominated for Best Rap
    Solo Performance at the 1998 Grammy Awards. The single reached
    #10 in the UK, making this his first top 10 hit in that
    country.</p>
      <p>The rhythm track of "Hypnotize" is based upon a sample of
    "Rise", a Herb Alpert instrumental, written by Andy Armer and
    Randy Badazz Alpert, that was a number-one hit in the U.S. in
    1979.</p>
      <p>The chorus of "Hypnotize", sung by Pamela Long of Total,
    contains an interpolation of "La Di Da Di" by Doug E. Fresh and
    Slick Rick.</p>
      <p>, The song is featured in the film 
    <i>10 Things I Hate About You</i>in a scene where an
    intoxicated Julia Stiles dances on a table.</p>
      <p>The song is also featured in B.I.G.'s biopic 
    <i>Notorious</i>. The song is also the film's theme song as it
    is played 3 times throughout the film. It was also used in most
    of the film's advertisements.</p>
      <p>The song features many pop culture references to television
    and film including "Star Wars", "Roots", "Starsky and Hutch",
    "King of New York" and "Richie Rich" and The Crystals' Da Doo
    Run Run. As well as references to popular fashion lines
    "Versace", "DKNY", "Moschino" and "Coogi".</p>
