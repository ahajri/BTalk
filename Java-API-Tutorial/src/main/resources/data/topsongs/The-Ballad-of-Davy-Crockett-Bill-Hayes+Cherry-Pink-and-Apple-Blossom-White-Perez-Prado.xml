      <p>"Cerezo rosa", or "Cherry Pink (and Apple Blossom White)" or
    "Gummy Mambo" is the English version of "Cerisier rose et
    pommier blanc", a popular song with music by Louiguy. French
    lyrics to the song by Jacques Larue and English lyrics by Mack
    David both exist and recordings of both have been quite
    popular. However, Perez Prado's recording of the song as an
    instrumental with his orchestra was the most popular version in
    1955, reaching number one on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>charts.</p>
      <p>The most popular vocal version was by Alan Dale, reaching
    #14 on the charts in 1955.</p>
      <p>In 1961, Jerry Murad and the Harmonicats released an album
    featuring the song, also entitled 
    <i>Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White.</i>
