      <p>"Love Theme from Romeo and Juliet", also known as "A Time
    for Us", is an instrumental arranged by Henry Mancini. It was a
    number-one pop hit in the United States during the year 1969.
    It topped the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart on June 28, 1969,
    and remained there for two weeks.</p>
      <p>The melody is the theme from the movie 
    <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, which starred Leonard Whiting and
    Olivia Hussey. Rearranged by Mancini, the song started
    competing with rock and roll songs from The Beatles and the
    Rolling Stones on an Orlando, Florida radio station and spread
    from there. It faced stiff opposition from some radio states
    for being too soft. Those stations had to change their mind
    when the song become number one.</p>
      <p>This release also topped the U.S. easy listening chart for
    eight weeks.</p>
