      <p>"Judy in Disguise (With Glasses)" was a hit for the
    Louisiana-based John Fred and His Playboy Band in early 1968.
    The song, co-written with bandmate Andrew Bernard, was a parody
    of The Beatles' hit, "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds." According
    to 
    <i>The Billboard Book of Number One Hits</i>by Fred Bronson,
    the song was inspired by Fred's listening to "Lucy in the Sky
    with Diamonds" and mistakenly believing that the lyrics to the
    song were "Lucy in disguise with diamonds." Coincidentally, it
    went on to knock "Hello, Goodbye," another Beatles tune, off
    the #1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks in January
    1968. However, it also stuck Fred with a novelty act image he
    was never able to shake. Nevertheless, the song remains a
    favorite on oldies-oriented radio stations.</p>
