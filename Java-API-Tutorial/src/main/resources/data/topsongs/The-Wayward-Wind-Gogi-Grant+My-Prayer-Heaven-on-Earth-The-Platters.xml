      <p>"My Prayer" is a 1939 popular song with music by the famous
    salon violinist Georges Boulanger and lyrics by Jimmy Kennedy.
    It was originally written by Boulanger with the title "Avant de
    Mourir" in 1926. The lyrics for this version were added by
    Kennedy in 1939. Glenn Miller recorded the song that year for a
    #2 hit, and The Ink Spots' version reached #3 as well that
    year. It has been recorded many times since, but the biggest
    hit version was a revival in 1956 by The Platters. This version
    reached #1 on the charts and was featured in the 2008 film The
    Curious Case of Benjamin Button.</p>
