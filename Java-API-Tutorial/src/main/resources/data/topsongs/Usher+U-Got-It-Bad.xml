      <p>"U Got It Bad" is a 2001 single from Usher's 2001 album 
    <i>8701</i>. It was the second US single from the album and the
    third international single, reaching number 1 on the United
    States Billboard Hot 100 Singles Chart, and reaching the top 5
    in the United Kingdom and Australia.</p>
      <p>The single hit number one on December 15, 2001 but remained
    for only one week after being temporarily replaced by
    Nickelback's "How You Remind Me". "U Got It Bad" then returned
    to the number one spot on January 19, 2002 and spent five more
    weeks at the top of the chart.</p>
      <p>This song was produced by Jermaine Dupri and co-produced by
    Bryan-Michael Cox. The Soulpower remix, which incorporated some
    2-step garage elements, received significantly more airplay
    than the Dupri-produced version in some territories.</p>
      <p>The song is listed at #99 on the 
    <i>Billboard: All-Time Hot 100 Top Songs</i>[1], which is
    compiled by sales data. It was also named the 15th most
    successful song from 2000 to 2009, on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot 100 Songs of the Decade.</p>
