      <p>"My Love" is a 1965 single release by Petula Clark which in
    early 1966 became an international hit, reaching #1 in the
    US.</p>
      <p>Clark's regular songwriter and producer Tony Hatch wrote "My
    Love" while flying from London to Los Angeles, where he had a
    scheduled recording session with Clark. Originally Hatch had
    been occupied during the flight putting the finishing touches
    on another song: "The Life and Soul of the Party," which was to
    be Clark's next single but in casual conversation with the
    American sitting next to him Hatch was advised that this song's
    title would be meaningless to the American public. Hatch
    proceeded to write a song whose title - "My Love" - could not
    conceivably present any comprehension issue; the lyrics were
    completed on the plane and Hatch wrote the music soon after
    landing.</p>
      <p>"My Love" was recorded at Western Studios [1] and featured
    the backing of the Wrecking Crew.</p>
      <p>Clark had disliked the song and had to be persuaded to
    record it; she remained unhappy with the recorded track and
    begged Warner Bros. Records not to release it. However Joe
    Smith, the Warner Brothers executive who had first brought
    Clark to the label after hearing "Downtown", was determined
    that "My Love" be Clark's next single.</p>
      <p>Released in December 1965, "My Love" became Clark's second
    single to reach #1 on the in February 1966 making Clark the
    first British female to have two US #1 hits. Also a #1 hit in
    Canada, "My Love" returned Clark to the UK Top Ten for the
    first time since "Downtown" two years previous with a March
    1966 peak of #4. "My Love" became a certified Gold record for
    US sales of one million units and in the UK the single earned a
    Silver disc for sales of 200,000 units.</p>
      <p>"My Love" also provided Clark with a hit in Australia (#4),
    New Zealand (#6), Rhodesia (#1) and South Africa (#6) and
    reached #13 in both the Netherlands and the Dutch speaking
    region of Belgium. In Germany "My Love" became a hit first in
    its original English version (#13) and then again when rendered
    in German as "Verzeih' die dummen Tr√§nen" (Forgive the foolish
    tears) (#21). Translated recordings by Clark also made "My
    Love" a hit in France and Italy, respectively as "Mon amour"
    (#12) and "L'amore e il vento" (Love is the wind) (#24).</p>
      <p>C&amp;W singer Sonny James covered "My Love" in 1970. His
    version reached No. 1 that May on the 
    <i>Billboard magazine</i>Hot Country Singles chart, in the
    midst of his then-record string of 16-straight No. 1 singles in
    as many releases . Also in 1970 C&amp;W singer Barbara
    Fairchild recorded "My Love" for her debut album 
    <i>Someone Special</i>.</p>
      <p>This song was also covered by Mrs. Miller in 1966, on her
    debut album with Capitol Records entitled 
    <i>Mrs. Miller's Greatest Hits</i>and is on the 1997
    compilation CD of her work released on Capitol's Ultra-Lounge
    label: 
    <i>Wild, Cool &amp; Swingin', The Artist Collection Vol. 3:
    Mrs. Miller</i>.</p>
      <p>John Davidson covered it in 1966 for his album 
    <i>Time of My Life!</i>.</p>
      <p>Actress/singer Florence Henderson performed the song as a
    serenade on the famous 1969 "Tonight Show" segment in which
    Tiny Tim married Miss Vicky.</p>
