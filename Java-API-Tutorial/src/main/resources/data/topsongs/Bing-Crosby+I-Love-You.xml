      <p>"I Love You" is a song written by Cole Porter in 1944 for
    his stage musical 
    <i>Mexican Hayride</i>. It was popularized by Bing Crosby in
    the same year. The lyrics of the chorus are satirically and
    deliberately banal, the verse apologizing for the use of
    lyrical cliches.</p>
      <p>Versions have also been recorded by Frank Sinatra, Jo
    Stafford and John Coltrane.</p>
      <p>Barbra Streisand performed several lines in her "Color Me
    Barbra Medley" from the TV special and album "Color Me
    Barbra".</p>
