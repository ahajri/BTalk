      <p>"Magic" is a hit 1980 song performed by Olivia Newton-John,
    from the soundtrack to the film 
    <i>Xanadu</i>. The song was #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts
    for four weeks, from August 2 through August 29, 1980. It also
    reached a high of #2 on the Australian charts and #32 in the
    UK.</p>
      <p>"Magic" became Newton-John's biggest Adult Contemporary hit
    to date. It also became Newton-John's biggest pop hit until
    "Physical" ruled the Hot 100 for ten weeks beginning in
    November 1981.</p>
      <p>Two B-sides exist depending on what label and continent the
    song was released. "Fool Country" is the B-side of the MCA
    label release, which also features in the film "Xanadu" but was
    never released on The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack.
    "Whenever You're Away From Me" with Gene Kelly is the B-side of
    the Jet label release. It finally saw its CD debut in 2005 on
    Olivia's "Gold" CD. ABC Family star Meaghan Jette Martin remade
    the song and it will be featured on the Wizards of Waverly
    Place CD.</p>
