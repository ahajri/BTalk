      <p>"Jump" is a 1992 song by the hip hop duo Kris Kross. It was
    release as a single in early 1992 from their album 
    <i>Totally Krossed Out</i>. It achieved great success in many
    countries where it topped the charts, including Australia,
    Switzerland and the U.S.</p>
      <p>Kris Kross's members were only 12 and 13 years old when they
    recorded their hit song. Written by Treach of Naughty By
    Nature, and produced by Jermaine Dupri, "Jump" was the fastest
    selling single in fifteen years and stayed on top of the Hot
    100 for eight weeks. Kris Kross's debut album 
    <i>Totally Krossed Out</i>, which features "Jump", sold over
    four million copies. It also reached number one in Australia
    and New Zealand, and number 2 in the United Kingdom, held off
    the top by KWS' cover song "Please Don't Go". This song kept En
    Vogue's "My Lovin' (You're Never Gonna Get It)" from the top
    spot on the Billboard Hot 100 which the song peaked at number
    2.</p>
      <p>The song samples The Honeydrippers' "Impeach The President",
    Ohio Players' "Funky Worm" and Jackson 5's "I Want You Back";
    Kris Kross later toured Europe together with Michael Jackson.
    At the beginning of their song they dissed another kid group
    Another Bad Creation when Chris "Mac Daddy" Kelly said "don't
    try to compare us to another bad little fad".

The original song's introduction contained a sample of ABC's song
"Playground" which was followed by a scratching sound giving the
effect that their record was being taken off to play "Jump". This
was soon removed due to copyright infringement.
