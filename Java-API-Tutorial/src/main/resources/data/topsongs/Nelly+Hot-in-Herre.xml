      <p>"Hot in Herre" is a popular song and single performed by the
    hip-hop artist Nelly, and was released in 2002 as the first
    single on his album 
    <i>Nellyville</i>. The song's producers were The Neptunes. It
    is best known for the lyrics, "It's gettin' hot in here / So
    take off all your clothes".</p>
      <p>"Hot in Herre" incorporates the hook from go-go performer
    Chuck Brown's 1979 #1 R&amp;B hit "Bustin' Loose."</p>
      <p>The song gave him his first number one on the United States
    Billboard Hot 100 Singles Chart and reached number four in the
    UK. It later won Best Male Rap Solo Performance, a brand new
    category at the time, at the Grammy Awards of 2003.</p>
      <p>In 2008, it was ranked number 36 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs
    of Hip Hop.</p>
      <p>There were two music videos made for the single "Hot in
    Herre", one which takes place in a dance club and has an
    alternative to the video and one which takes place in the St.
    Louis Arch. The alternative video was played in MTV Europe
    instead of the official one.</p>
      <p>The original video features cameo appearances by
    actor/comedian Cedric the Entertainer and NFL players T.J.
    Duckett and Julius Peppers. It is quite famous because it
    features a club full of people sweating and stripping to the
    music.</p>

      <p>"Hot in Herre" has been covered by a number of artists,
    including The BossHoss; Jenny Owen Youngs (whose version also
    has an accompanying video on YouTube); Coldplay; Wang Chung, on
    the television show Hit Me Baby One More Time; Canadian
    electronic artist Tiga, who remade "Hot in Herre" with Scissor
    Sisters lead singer Jake Shears on vocals, giving it a more
    monotone, electro feel (this reached #46 in the UK); and
    Widespread Panic, whose cover was featured on an episode of the
    
    <i>O.C.</i>, is featured on their album 
    <i>Jackassolantern</i>, and was performed at one of their famed
    Halloween shows at UNO Lakefront Arena in New Orleans. In the
    live version of "Jocko Homo" on Devo's album, 
    <i>DEVOlution is Real: Live in Central Park</i>, Mark
    Mothersbaugh briefly sings the chorus of "Hot in Herre" before
    Jocko Homo's "O-HI-O" breakdown. Jill Sobule covered the song
    acoustically at a live performance in Seattle with Melissa
    Ferrick. The small-time Minnesotan band "The Pickle Farmers"
    are currently recording a cover of the song.</p>
      <p>"Hot in Herre" was a popular dance and sporting event
    favorite, and Ray Lewis of the Baltimore Ravens uses the song
    as part of his home-field entrance.</p>
      <p>The song also gains mention in the Big and Rich song "Caught
    Up in the Moment" with the lyrics "It's like Nelly said, it's
    getting hot in herre".</p>
      <p>The song is mentioned in 
    <i>Invasion of the Boysnatchers</i>, a clique novel by Lisi
    Harrison.</p>
      <p>A sample of the song was used in the later seasons of Montel
    Williams' self-titled chat show.</p>
      <p>In the movie Agent Cody Banks, they use the song to
    introduce the sexy Ronica Miles.</p>
      <p>In the HBO's mini-series Generation kill two marines sing it
    in the episode 3: ´´screwby``</p>
      <p>In the U.S., "Hot in Herre" became Nelly's first number one
    on the Billboard charts and was number three in the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Year-End Hot 100 Singles Chart for 2002.</p>
