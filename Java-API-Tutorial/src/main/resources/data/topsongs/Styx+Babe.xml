      <p>"Babe" was the lead single from Styx's 1979 triple-platinum
    album 
    <i>Cornerstone</i>. The song was Styx's first, and only, U.S.
    number-one single.</p>
      <p>The song was written by member Dennis DeYoung as a birthday
    present for his wife Suzanne. The finished track was recorded
    as a demo with just DeYoung and Styx members John Panozzo and
    Chuck Panozzo playing on the track, with DeYoung singing all of
    the harmonies himself.</p>
      <p>The song was not originally intended to be a Styx track, but
    Styx members James "J.Y" Young and Tommy Shaw convinced DeYoung
    to put the song on 
    <i>Cornerstone</i>. As a result, DeYoung's demo was placed on 
    <i>Cornerstone</i>with Shaw overdubbing a guitar solo in the
    song's middle section. The track became a major hit, reaching
    #1 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and was their only major UK hit
    single, reaching #6.</p>
      <p>VH1 ranked it the second most "softsational" soft rock song
    of all time.</p>
      <p>Dutch boy band Caught In The Act covered this track to
    relative success. Alexander O'Neal covered the song on his 2008
    album, 
    <i>Alex Loves</i>. Philippine singer April Boy Regino also
    covered the song in his 2000 album Super Idol. This song is
    also covered by Piolo Pascual for the movie Babe, I Love You
    from Star Cinema in the Philippines.</p>
