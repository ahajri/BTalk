      <p>"Incomplete" is a 2000 number-one single recorded by Sisqó
    for Def Soul Records. Written by Def Soul artist Montell Jordan
    and Anthony "Shep" Crawford, and produced by Crawford, the song
    was Sisqó's biggest solo single, and his only number-one hit.
    "Incomplete" is taken from Sisqó's first solo album, 
    <i>Unleash the Dragon</i>.</p>
      <p>The song was originally recorded by LaFace Records artist
    Sam Salter, whose version remains in the vaults. Jordan and
    Crawford offered "Incomplete" to Sisqó in 1999, as he was
    recording his debut solo album. Sisqó wasn't particularly fond
    of the song, a slow ballad close in style to those he recorded
    as lead singer of Dru Hill, and had to be coerced into
    recording the composition.</p>
      <p>"Incomplete" features Sisqó in the role of a rich and famous
    man who appears to have everything he wants in life, except for
    the love of the woman (played by LisaRaye McCoy) who left him
    some time ago. The song's music video, directed by Chris
    Robinson, depicts Sisqó as living a solitary life in a large
    mansion, and spending his free time remembering his happier
    times.</p>
      <p>The song was a number-one hit on both the Billboard Hot 100
    chart and the Billboard Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp;
    Tracks chart. "Incomplete" is also Sisqó's third and final Hot
    100 Top 40 hit; within two years of "Incomplete"'s release,
    Sisqó would return to his role as Dru Hill's lead singer.</p>
