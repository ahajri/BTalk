      <p>"The Power of Love" is the title of a 1985 single by Huey
    Lewis and the News written for and featured in the 1985
    blockbuster film 
    <i>Back to the Future</i>. It gave the band their first
    number-one hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, their second
    number-one hit on the U.S. Top Rock Tracks chart, and was a top
    ten hit on the UK Singles Chart, where it appeared on UK
    editions of the band's fourth studio album, 
    <i>Fore!</i>. The song was nominated for an Academy Award at
    the 58th Academy Awards.</p>
      <p>The song appears early in 
    <i>Back to the Future</i>as Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox)
    skateboards to school, then when he and his band played the
    song for a Battle of the Bands auditions (which Lewis, himself,
    is judging, and tells Marty's group that they "are just too
    darn loud"), and later when Marty returns to his neighborhood.
    In the sequel, 
    <i>Back to the Future Part II</i>, the 2015 version of Marty
    attempts to play the song on his guitar just after being fired,
    but ends up playing it very poorly due to his damaged hand from
    his 1985 accident with a Rolls-Royce. Finally, it can be
    briefly heard playing in the car where Needles and his buddies
    are driving when Needles challenges Marty to the
    fate-determining car race near the end of 
    <i>Back to the Future Part III</i>.</p>
      <p>The music video shows the band playing in a nightclub with
    Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) showing up in his
    DeLorean, apparently after time-traveling, and a couple
    stealing it for a joy ride.</p>
