      <p>"You're Makin' Me High" is the lead single from Toni
    Braxton's second studio album, 
    <i>Secrets</i>(1996). A joint collaboration between the Grammy
    Award-winning producer Babyface and Bryce Wilson resulted in
    this mid-tempo song. The song was issued in the United States
    as a double A-side with "Let It Flow", the airplay hit from the
    1995 motion picture 
    <i>Waiting to Exhale</i>.</p>
      <p>It became Braxton's first number-one single on both the Hot
    100 and Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs charts; it remained atop for
    one week on the former and for two weeks on the latter,
    eventually going platinum by the RIAA. A dance remix by Morales
    allowed the single to also top the Hot Dance Club Play chart
    for two weeks in August 1996.</p>
      <p>The song earned Braxton her third Grammy Award for Best
    Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance in 1997. The success of
    "You're Makin' Me High" would later be continued with the
    release of "Un-Break My Heart". The song was sampled for Method
    Man &amp; Redman's 2001 song "Part II", from the 
    <i>How High</i>soundtrack.</p>
      <p>The music video, directed by Bille Woodruff, features
    Braxton and a group of friends (consisting of actresses Tisha
    Campbell-Martin, Erika Alexander, and Vivica A. Fox) enjoying
    themselves in luxurious surroundings. An elevator brings up a
    series of men, some very attractive and others amusingly
    unattractive. Braxton and her friends "judge" the men using
    oversized playing cards as score cards. Periodically, one of
    the women will choose a man to leave with. Braxton chooses
    Bryce Wilson and they are shown together in a bathtub of cotton
    candy and on a dance floor.</p>
