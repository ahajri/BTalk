      <p>"Fly, Robin, Fly" is a 1975 song by the German group Silver
    Convention. The song was released as a single from their 1975
    album 
    <i>Save Me</i>. In the United States, it rose to number one on
    the Hot 100 in November 1975, staying there for three weeks.
    The single also stayed at number one on the soul singles chart
    for one week. "Fly, Robin, Fly" also spent three weeks at
    number one on the disco/dance charts. It was the first song by
    a German pop group to reach number one on the American music
    charts.</p>
      <p>"Fly, Robin, Fly" carries the distinction of being a
    Billboard chart-topper with one of the fewest numbers of unique
    words: six. The chorus simply repeats "
    <i>Fly, robin, fly</i>" three times, with an ending of "
    <i>Up, up to the sky!</i>" This was because the singers had
    trouble learning English, and they didn't want to have to learn
    an entire song to sing.</p>
      <p>During the song's segment on VH1's 100 Greatest Dance Songs,
    it was revealed that the song's working title was "Run, Rabbit,
    Run".</p>
      <p>"Fly, Robin, Fly" won a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B
    Instrumental Performance in 1976.</p>
      <p>American jazz flautist Herbie Mann recorded a version of
    "Fly, Robin, Fly" for his 1976 album, 
    <i>Bird in a Silver Cage,</i>which was co-produced and arranged
    by Sylvester Levay.</p>
      <p>Australian/British string quartet Bond also recorded a
    version of "Fly, Robin, Fly" for their 2004 album, 
    <i>Classified.</i>
      </p>
      <p>In 2003, German lifestyle company Apartment20 produced a
    version of "Fly, Robin, Fly," which featured former Silver
    Convention singer Ramona Wulf on lead vocals and in the video
    for the song.</p>
