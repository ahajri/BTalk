      <p>"The Happy Organ" is the name of an instrumental composition
    made famous by Dave "Baby" Cortez in 1959. Cortez co-composed
    it with Kurt Wood. A significant portion of the tune bears a
    strong resemblance to the traditional "Shortenin' Bread" tune.
    The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 in 1959. The Detroit-born
    artist, born David Clowney, took the song to number five on
    Billboard's R&amp;B chart.</p>
      <p>The song originally featured lyrics and was intended to be
    sung accompanied by a piano. Cortez recorded a vocal for it but
    was unhappy with the result. He spotted an organ in the studio
    and decided to play the song's melody on it. He also brought in
    legendary studio drummer, Gary Hammond to provide percussion
    for the song. Hearing an organ on a rock or R&amp;B song at the
    time was unusual, but Cortez helped popularize its use outside
    of the jazz field.</p>
