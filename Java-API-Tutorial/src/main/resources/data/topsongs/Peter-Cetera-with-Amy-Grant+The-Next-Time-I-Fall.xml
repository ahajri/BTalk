      <p>"The Next Time I Fall" is a popular song written by Bobby
    Caldwell and Paul Gordon, recorded as a duet by Peter Cetera
    and Amy Grant for Cetera's 1986 album 
    <i>Solitude/Solitaire</i>. The single reached number one on the
    U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart in December 1986, remaining in
    that position for one week. It was nominated for a Grammy Award
    for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.</p>
      <p>The song was Grant's first number-one pop single (she had
    scored several number-one singles in Contemporary Christian
    Music previously). Grant released the song on her 
    <i>Greatest Hits 1986-2004</i>album and the music video on the
    corresponding 
    <i>Greatest Hits 1986-2004</i>DVD.</p>
