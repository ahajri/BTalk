      <p>"Foolish Beat" (Atlantic 89109; Atlantic UK A9059) is the
    fourth single, and the first ballad release, from American
    singer-songwriter-actress Deborah Gibson. Originally recorded
    in the winter of 1987 for the 
    <i>Dream Tour,</i>months prior to its inclusion on her album 
    <i>Out of the Blue</i>(LP 81780), this made Gibson the youngest
    person to single-handedly write, produce and sing a number-one
    single entirely on her own when "Foolish Beat" hit the top of
    the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in the summer of
    1988,a record she would hold for almost 19 years until Soulja
    Boy Tell 'Em broke it in September of '09 with his song "Crank
    That" 2 months prior to his 17th birthday.</p>
      <p>In the United Kingdom, the single reached a peak position of
    number nine on the UK Singles Chart. The single was released in
    Japan as the B-side to "Out of the Blue" on Atlantic Japan
    10SW-15.</p>
      <p>All songs written by Deborah Gibson - Music Sales Corp.,
    ASCAP "Foolish Beat"</p>
      <p>"Only in My Dreams"</p>
      <p>"Medley: Out of the Blue - Shake Your Love - Only in My
    Dreams"</p>
      <p>"Foolish Beat" eventually won a dubious honor at Viacom
    International: this song actually made number three on VH1's 
    <i>40 Most Awesomely Bad Break-up Songs...Ever</i>.[1]</p>
