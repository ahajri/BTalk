      <p>"What's Love Got to Do with It" is the second single
    released from Tina Turner's breakthrough solo debut album, 
    <i>Private Dancer</i>. In the UK and Continental Europe it was
    the third single, following Turner's cover of The Beatles'
    "Help!". The song is widely credited for the huge success of
    the 
    <i>Private Dancer</i>album itself. "What's Love Got to Do With
    It" is arguably Tina Turner's most popular and successful
    single, becoming her first number-one hit in the United States
    and establishing Tina Turner as a mainstream Pop and Rock
    artist, while also reaching number one in Australia and number
    three in the UK. In 1993, the song's name was used as the title
    for 
    <i>What's Love Got to Do With It</i>, a biographical film about
    Turner's life leading up to the actual release of the song. The
    music video was directed by Mark Robinson. It is ranked #309 on
    the 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>magazine's list of "The 500 Greatest Songs
    of All Time". It also ranked #38 on Songs of the Century. It
    was the 17th best-selling single of 1984 in the UK. The song
    was originally recorded by UK pop group Bucks Fizz, but
    unreleased until 2000.</p>
      <p>Tina Turner had not had a top twenty single in thirteen
    years, and Capitol Records did not expect the song to turn out
    to be the hit it became. The song was originally written for
    the R&amp;B singer Phyllis Hyman. "What's Love Got to Do With
    It" went straight to number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and
    remained there for three weeks, becoming Turner's first number
    one hit. Billboard ranked it as the number two single of 1984.
    Tina Turner's first single ("A Fool in Love" with her
    then-husband Ike) had charted in 1960, and she achieved her
    first number-one single on September 1, 1984, which set a new
    record from the longest span between an artist's first charted
    record and first number-one single (a difference of 24 years,
    to the exact week). It also established another record, as
    Turner was 45-years-old when the song went to number one,
    making her the oldest female artist to place a number-one
    single on the Hot 100, until Grace Slick (with Starship) broke
    the record twice (in 1985) with "We Built This City" and 1987
    with "Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now"). Cher later broke Slick's
    record in 1999.</p>
      <p>The video features Turner walking down the street, intercut
    with scenes when she's singing directly to the viewers. The
    video was shot in New York City.</p>
      <p>The song was honored with several awards welcoming Turner's
    comeback, including the Grammy Awards of 1985. The music video
    for the song also claimed a prize at the MTV Video Music Awards
    in 1985, as the "Best Female Video".</p>
