      <p>"Livin' la Vida Loca" (English: 
    <span lang="en">
            <i>Livin' the Crazy Life</i>
         </span>) is a song by Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin. It was
    released in 1999 from Martin's self-titled debut English album.
    The song was composed by Desmond Child and Draco Rosa and
    topped the charts during 1999. It received various Grammy
    nominations and helped Ricky Martin obtain enormous success
    inside the United States and worldwide.</p>
      <p>The song is generally seen as the song that began the Latin
    pop explosion of 1999, and making the acceptance of other Latin
    artists (first Jennifer Lopez and Enrique Iglesias, then later
    Shakira, Thalía and Paulina Rubio) easier to crossover into the
    English market. Before this time, most non-Latino Americans had
    never heard of Ricky Martin until what CNN reported was a
    show-stopping performance of "La Copa de la Vida" at the 1999
    Grammy Awards show, which became a catalyst in bringing Latin
    pop to the forefront of the U.S. music scene. The song was
    awarded "Pop Song of the Year" at the 2000 Premio Lo Nuestro
    Awards. A cover version by Antonio Banderas and Eddie Murphy
    was featured in the film 
    <i>Shrek 2.</i>"Livin la Vida Loca" was Ricky Martin's first
    number-one hit on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot 100, remaining at number one in the U.S.
    for five weeks and ranking at #10 on the year-end charts for
    1999. The single was certified Gold on May 15 and Platinum on
    June 4, for sales over one million copies in the U.S.
    alone.</p>
      <p>The video was directed by Wayne Isham in March 1999, and
    received six nominations at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards
    including Video of the Year, Best Male Video, Best Choreography
    in a Video and Viewer's Choice. It won two primary awards for
    Best Pop Video, and Best Dance Video, and was voted two
    additional awards in the international Viewers Choice
    categories.</p>
      <p>In 2007, the song was named one of the 20 Most Annoying
    Songs by Rolling Stone. The song was ranked at #28 on the list
    of 
    <i>100 Greatest Songs of the 90's</i>by VH1.</p>
