      <p>"Another Day in Paradise" is a song by Phil Collins released
    as the first single from his number-one album 
    <i>...But Seriously</i>(1989). As with his song from Genesis,
    "Man on the Corner" "Another Day in Paradise" was written to
    bring attention to the problem of homelessness,; as such, the
    song was a substantial departure from the dance-pop music of
    his previous album, 
    <i>No Jacket Required</i>(1985). The song was a number-one hit
    around the world, and his most successful song. It eventually
    won Collins and producer Hugh Padgham the 1991 Grammy Award for
    Record of the Year. The song also won Best British Single at
    the 1990 Brit Awards.</p>
      <p>Collins's version was listed at #86 on 
    <i>Billboard's Greatest Songs of all time.</i>
      </p>
      <p>The song was another huge hit for Collins. On 23 December
    1989, it became Collins's seventh (and to date, final)
    number-one single in the United States. The song was also the
    final number-one song of the 1980s in the U.S., and remained at
    number-one for four weeks, which sometimes classifies the song
    as a hit from the 1990s as well. It also saw out the 1980s and
    saw in the 1990s at the top of the German singles chart. The
    song had already reached number two in the UK in November of
    that year. The single version is slightly different from the
    album version in that it uses a shorter intro. David Crosby
    also appears on the backing vocals. The track is also recorded
    using a tuning that is approximately two-thirds of a quarter
    tone sharp of the standard A440.</p>
      <p>Listeners to BBC Radio 1's breakfast show, hosted by Simon
    Mayo, voted for the Phil Collins original as the Best Single at
    the 1990 BRIT Awards.</p>

    single-releases of "Another Day in Paradise."</p>
      <p>Fewer than six months after its release, a cover version was
    in the UK singles charts by dance act Jam Tronik. Although a
    major departure in terms of genre, it was a respectful cover
    and in April, it reached its peak position of number 19 on the
    UK singles chart, lower than the original number 2 song.
    However, it did become a hit single and was featured on volume
    17 of the popular UK series 
    <i>Now That's What I Call Music!</i>. To date, Jam Tronix have
    not made another appearance on the UK chart or another single,
    which makes them a one hit wonder.</p>
      <p>After the show 
    <i>Moesha</i>had its last episode in 2001, siblings Brandy and
    Ray J stepped back into the studio and covered the song for the
    Phil Collins tribute album 
    <i>Urban Renewal</i>(2001). Produced by Guy Roche and released
    as the album's lead single, it became a top ten success in
    Austria, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Belgium, Norway,
    Ireland, the Netherlands and UK, receiving gold certifications
    in Australia (35,000), Germany (150,000), France (100,000) and
    in Switzerland (25,000). In 2002, the song was included on the
    European Edition of 
    <i>Full Moon</i>.</p>
