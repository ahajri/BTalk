      <p>"It's Only Make Believe" is a song written by Jack Nance and
    Conway Twitty, released by Twitty as a single in 1958. The
    single topped both U.S. and British national charts, and was
    Twitty's only number-one single on the pop charts of either
    country.</p>
      <p>The song's lyrics describe the thoughts and feelings of a
    man in love with a woman who does not seem to be in love with
    him. He hopes and prays that, at some point in the future, the
    woman will be able to return his love, but laments that, at
    present, "it's only make believe."</p>
      <p>Billy Fury had a UK #10 hit with his version in 1964, which
    also went to #1 in Singapore. Glen Campbell's 1970 recording
    became a top ten hit in both the United States and United
    Kingdom. Ronnie McDowell had a #8 single on the Billboard
    country chart in 1988 after recording the song as a duet with
    Twitty. The horror punk band Misfits have a cover version on
    their album Project 1950, titled "Only Make Believe".</p>
