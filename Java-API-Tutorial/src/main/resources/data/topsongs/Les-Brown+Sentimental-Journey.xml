      <p>"Sentimental Journey" is a popular song, published in 1944.
    The music was written by Les Brown and Ben Homer, and the
    lyrics were written by Bud Green.</p>
      <p>Les Brown and His Band of Renown, with Doris Day as
    vocalist, had a hit record with the song, Day's first #1 hit,
    in 1945. The song's release coincided with the end of WWII in
    Europe and became the unofficial homecoming theme for many
    veterans. The recording was released by Columbia Records as
    catalog number 36769, with the flip side "Twilight Time". The
    record first reached the 
    <i>Billboard</i>charts on March 29, 1945 and lasted 23 weeks on
    the chart, peaking at #1. The song actually reached the charts
    after the later-recorded "My Dreams Are Getting Better All the
    Time".</p>
      <p>In 1951, Brown's orchestra redid the song, with The Ames
    Brothers on vocals. This was released by Coral Records as
    catalog number 60566, with the flip side "Undecided".</p>
      <p>Ella Fitzgerald recorded this song with Eddie Heywood and
    his Orchestra in 1947, it was later released on her Decca album
    "Ella and Her Fellas"</p>
      <p>The song later became something of a standard with jazz
    artists and was recorded, among others, by Buck Clayton with
    Woody Herman and by Ben Sidran. Rosemary Clooney issued an
    album 
    <i>Sentimental Journey</i>(2001) which included the song.</p>
      <p>Ringo Starr covered this song for his 1970 album 
    <i>Sentimental Journey</i>.</p>
      <p>Dave Dudley brought the song to country music with his top
    50 version in 1976.</p>
      <p>Nellie McKay recorded her own arrangement as part of her
    album 
    <i>Normal as Blueberry Pie - A Tribute to Doris Day</i>.</p>
      <p>Booker T. &amp; the M.G.'s recorded an instrumental cover of
    this song for their 1966 album And Now!.</p>
      <p>The song features prominently in the M*A*S*H episode 
    <i>Your Hit Parade</i>as Colonel Potter requests the song be
    played several times during the day.</p>
