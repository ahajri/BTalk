      <p>"Thank God I Found You" is a song written and produced by
    American singer Mariah Carey, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis for
    Carey's sixth studio album 
    <i>Rainbow</i>(1999). It features Joe, and boyband 98 Degrees,
    and was inspired by Carey's boyfriend at the time, Luis Miguel.
    The romantic ballad provides a metaphorical closure for Carey's
    album 
    <i>Rainbow</i>, as it is the "rainbow" (happiness) that comes
    after the "storm" (relationship problems). It was released with
    a remix as the second single from the album in 2000 and reached
    number 1 in the United States, but was only moderately
    successful in other countries.</p>
      <p>"Thank God I Found You" reached number one on the U.S.
    Billboard Hot 100 and Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs charts, and
    gave Carey the record for number 1 singles for eleven
    consecutive years â€” from 1990 (starting with her debut single
    "Vision of Love") to 2000. It also marked her seventh R&amp;B
    chart topper. It spent one week at the top of the chart,
    temporarily displacing "I Knew I Loved You" by Savage Garden.
    The RIAA certified it gold in February 2000. "Thank God I Found
    You" was Carey's last number 1 hit in the U.S. until "We Belong
    Together" (2005), the first U.S. number 1 single for Joe and
    the only number 1 single for 98 Degrees.</p>
      <p>Outside the U.S., the single was most successful in Canada
    where it reached number 2. It also reached the top ten in the
    United Kingdom, but only reached the top forty in Australia,
    France and Germany.</p>
      <p>The song was nominated for the 2001 Grammy Award for Best
    Pop Collaboration with Vocals, losing to B. B. King and Dr.
    John for "Is You Is, or Is You Ain't (My Baby)".</p>
      <p>The song's main remix is titled "Thank God I Found You/Make
    It Last Forever," or "Thank God I Found You" (Make It Last
    Remix) and it's the second Mariah Carey remix that was ever
    produced by Desert Storm Records producer &amp; rapper DJ Clue.
    Re-recorded with new vocals, it was created by interpolating
    the song with Keith Sweat's "Make It Last Forever" and bears
    few lyrical/melodic similarities to the original version of
    "Thank God I Found You." The remix again features Joe, but not
    98 Degrees; Columbia Records labelmate Nas provides two rapped
    verses on the song instead. The remix was included on Joe's
    third album 
    <i>My Name Is Joe</i>(2000). The British remix team Stargate
    produced the U.K. Stargate radio mix, which strips down the
    production and sythesizers of the clickity beat of the original
    to give it a more orchestral, organic feel. Jimmy Jam and Terry
    Lewis also created the synthesizer-heavy Celebratory Remix.</p>
      <p>The single's music video, directed by Brett Ratner, shows
    Carey performing the song with Joe and 98 Degrees at Minnesota
    radio station 101.3 KDWB's annual Last Chance Summer Dance
    summer music concert. The video shows saturated blue skies and
    behind the scenes footage of Carey carousing with her dog Jack
    and writing lyrics. Additionally, there is a video for the
    "Make It Last Remix" that features Carey with braids in a
    nightclub with Joe and Nas. Directed by Sanaa Hamri, the video
    is grainy and filmed to simulate a home video.</p>
