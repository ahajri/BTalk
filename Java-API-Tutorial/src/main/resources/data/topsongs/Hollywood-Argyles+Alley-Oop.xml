      <p>"Alley Oop" is a song written by Dallas Frazier. The song,
    heavily inspired by the V. T. Hamlin-created comic strip of the
    same name, was first recorded by Frazier as a country tune in
    1957.</p>
      <p>The Hollywood Argyles recorded the song in 1960 and hit
    number one on the Hot 100. It was produced by Gary S. Paxton.
    The lead vocalist on the track was Norm Davis. He was paid a
    one-time fee of $25 for his work on the single. He is currently
    a poet and poetry teacher in Rochester, New York.</p>
      <p>This version of the story is contested by Gary Paxton.
    Paxton writes:</p>
      <p>Also in 1960, The Dyno-Sores and Dante &amp; The Evergreens
    took versions of the song to numbers 59 and 15, respectively,
    on the Hot 100 chart. Both Dante &amp; The Evergreens' and the
    Argyles' versions were credited as number ones in Cashbox
    magazine's singles chart.</p>
      <p>The Beach Boys recorded and released their version on their
    1965 album 
    <i>Beach Boys' Party!</i>. The British satirical art rock/pop
    group, The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, recorded a version of "Alley
    Oop", which was released as their second single in October
    1966. It was also performed by Dave Van Ronk and the Hudson
    Dusters on their self-titled album, released in 1967.</p>
      <p>Actress-singer Darlene Love recorded a version of the song
    for the 1984 film 
    <i>Bachelor Party</i>., George Thorogood also did a version of
    this song and was on the Live CD that was released February 15,
    1989.</p>
