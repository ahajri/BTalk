   <descr>
      <p>"I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)" is a 1981 song recorded by
    Daryl Hall and John Oates.</p>
      <p>It was the fourth number-one hit single of their career on
    the Billboard Hot 100 and the second hit single from their
    album 
    <i>Private Eyes</i>. It features Charles DeChant on
    saxello.</p>
      <p>On January 30, 1982, "I Can't Go for That" ended a 10-week
    run at the top of the Hot 100 by Olivia Newton-John's song,
    "Physical". "Physical" had knocked out "Private Eyes" from the
    top spot.</p>
      <p>Thanks to heavy airplay on urban contemporary stations, "I
    Can't Go for That" also topped the U.S. R&amp;B chart, a rare
    feat for a non-African American act. The song also went to
    number one on the Hot Dance Club Play chart for one week in
    January 1982.</p>
      <p>According to the Hall and Oates biography, Hall upon
    learning that "I Can't Go For That" had gone to number one on
    the R&amp;B chart, wrote in his diary, "I'm the head soul
    brother in the U.S. Where to now?"</p>
      <p>"I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)" is one of the 14 Hall and
    Oates songs that have been played on the radio over one million
    times, according to BMI.</p>
      <p>The single 45 version is actually not just an edit of the
    album song, but an edit of the dance mix rather than the
    version from "Private Eyes".</p>
      <p>Daryl Hall sketched out the basic song one evening at a
    music studio in New York City in 1981 after a recording session
    for the 
    <i>Private Eyes</i>album. Hall began to play a bass line on a
    Korg organ, and sound engineer Neil Kernon recorded the result.
    Hall then came up with a guitar riff, which he and Oates worked
    on together. The next day, Hall and longtime collaborator Sara
    Allen completed the lyrics.</p>
      <p>"I Can't Go for That" was voted number six on VH1's list of
    "The 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s".</p>
      <p>The song has been covered by a number of recording artists
    including Brian McKnight, The Nylons, Les Go (with Alfredo
    Alias), Donny Osmond, East End, Kansascali, Orson and The Bird
    and the Bee.</p>
      <p>Olivia Ong recorded a Bossa Nova based version on her 2010
    album, called Olivia.</p>
      <p>The original track has often been sampled in R&amp;B and
    hip-hop songs. The following is a partial list:</p>
      <p>Some songs have included a vocal interpolation of the
    chorus, including:</p>
      <p>Other songs have included a re-recorded variation of the
    song's famous descending arpeggio, including:</p>
      <p>Additionally, the JP/PAL Version of Sonic CD's Boss music
    beat is sampled from this song.</p>
