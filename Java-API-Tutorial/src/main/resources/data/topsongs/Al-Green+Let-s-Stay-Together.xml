      <p>"Let's Stay Together" is a song by Al Green on his 1972
    album of the same name. Released as a single in 1971, the song
    reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, and remained on the chart
    for 16 weeks and also topped Billboard's R&amp;B chart for nine
    weeks. It was ranked the 60th greatest song of all time by 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>magazine on their list of the 500 Greatest
    Songs of All Time.</p>
      <p>"Let's Stay Together" was later covered by Tina Turner, her
    second collaboration with the British Heaven 17/B.E.F.
    production team after "Ball of Confusion" in 1982, and served
    as her comeback single in late 1983, charting at number six in
    the UK (one place higher than Al Green's original - and her
    third UK Top 10 single, the first being "River Deep, Mountain
    High" and second being "Nutbush City Limits", (both with former
    husband Ike Turner). Tina Turner's version peaked at number 26
    on The Billboard Hot 100 and number three on the soul singles
    chart.. In addition, Turner's version of the song made it to
    number one on the US Dance Chart.. The song became a turning
    point in Turner's solo career and was later included on her
    multi-platinum selling album 
    <i>Private Dancer</i>, released in the Spring of 1984.</p>
