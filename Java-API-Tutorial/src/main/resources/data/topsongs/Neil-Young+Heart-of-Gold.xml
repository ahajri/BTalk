      <p>"Heart of Gold" from the 1972 album 
    <i>Harvest</i>is Neil Young's only number one hit single in his
    long musical career. 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>ranked it #297 on their list of the 500
    greatest songs of all time. It features the back-up vocals of
    James Taylor and Linda Ronstadt.</p>
      <p>The song is one of a series of soft, acoustic pieces which
    were written partly as a result of a back injury. Unable to
    stand for long periods of time, he could not play his electric
    guitar and so returned to his acoustic guitar, which he could
    play sitting down.</p>
      <p>The song was taped during the initial sessions for 
    <i>Harvest</i>in early 1971 at Quadrafonic Studios in
    Nashville, Tennessee. Ronstadt and Taylor were in Nashville at
    the time for an appearance on Johnny Cash's television program,
    and the album's producer Elliot Mazer arranged for them to sing
    backup for Young in the studio.</p>
      <p>Originally, this song was meant to segue with the song "A
    Man Needs a Maid", and was therefore played on piano. It was
    played in this manner during Young's solo shows in 1971, but he
    abandoned this approach midway through the tour and began to
    play it on guitar as it is now known. Additionally, one line
    that was cut when the two songs became separate entities was
    "Afraid/A man feels afraid" An example of the segued version
    appears on Young's 
    <i>Live at Massey Hall 1971</i>release.</p>
      <p>Young wrote in the liner notes of his compilation album 
    <i>Decade</i>: "This song put me in the middle of the road.
    Traveling there soon became a bore so I headed for the ditch. A
    rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there." This
    statement was in response to the mainstream popularity that he
    gained as a result of "Heart of Gold"'s number-one status.</p>
      <p>In 1985, Bob Dylan admitted that he hated this song, despite
    always liking Neil Young:</p>
      <p>The only time it bothered me that someone sounded like me
    was when I was living in Phoenix, Arizona, in about '72 and the
    big song at the time was "Heart of Gold." I used to hate it
    when it came on the radio. I always liked Neil Young, but it
    bothered me every time I listened to "Heart of Gold." I think
    it was up at number one for a long time, and I'd say, "Shit,
    that's me. If it sounds like me, it should as well be me."</p>
      <p>The song has been covered by Tanya Donelly, Matchbox Twenty,
    Tori Amos, Free Dominguez, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Richard
    Lloyd, Bettye Lavette, Birds and Batteries, Zakk Wylde (with
    Black Label Society), Boney M, Carla Cook, Lawrence Gowan,
    Stereophonics, Rockapella, Roxette, Backburner, Hanah, Ossifar,
    the James Last Orchestra, Five for Five, Sally Dworsky,
    Channeling Owen, Stoney LaRue, The Bad Plus, Dave Matthews and
    Jimmy Buffett (with the Coral Reefer Band), and as a Karaoke
    backing track. It is also heard briefly in the film 
    <i>Iceman</i>.</p>
      <p>In 2005, "Heart of Gold" was named the third greatest
    Canadian song of all time on the CBC Radio One series 
    <i>50 Tracks: The Canadian Version</i>. It ranked behind only
    Barenaked Ladies' "If I Had $1000000" and Ian and Sylvia's
    "Four Strong Winds".</p>
