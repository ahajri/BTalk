      <p>"(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear" is a popular song. It was
    written by Kal Mann and Bernie Lowe and published in 1957.</p>
      <p>The song was a US number-one hit for Elvis Presley during
    the summer of 1957, and his third of the four that he would
    have that year. "(Let Me be Your) Teddy Bear" would also hit
    number one on the R&amp;B Best Sellers List, becoming his
    fourth number one on that chart . In addition the song would
    hit number one on the country charts for a single week .</p>
      <p>A modified version of the song has often been used for Teddy
    Grahams commercials. Also, during the early years of Full
    House, the three main adult characters would often sing the
    song as a lullaby for Michelle Tanner (one of those three
    characters, Michelle's uncle Jesse Katsopolis, was a die-hard
    Elvis fan).</p>
      <p>Disney featured a music video in the special 
    <i>DTV Romancin'</i>, set entirely to clips featuring the bear
    characters from the company's animated films, including an
    introduction by the Gummi Bears.</p>
