      <p>"Oh Girl" is a number one single recorded by the soul vocal
    group, The Chi-Lites and released on Brunswick Records in 1972.
    Included on the group's 1972 album 
    <i>A Lonely Man</i>, "Oh Girl" centers around a relationship on
    the verge of break-up. The narrator, portrayed by the song's
    author Eugene Record, expresses concern that the break-up may
    prove unbearable for him (
    <i>"Oh girl/I'd be in trouble if you left me now/'Cause I don't
    know where to look for love/I just don't know how"</i>), while
    knowing that staying will be no better (
    <i>"I could save myself a lot of useless tears/Girl I've got to
    get away from here"</i>; 
    <i>"Better be on my way, I can't stay here"</i>).</p>
      <p>"Oh Girl" was the Chi-Lites' first and only number one
    single on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at that position in
    May 1972 for one week. The single also reached the top position
    of Billboard's R&amp;B Singles chart the following month,
    remaining in that position for two weeks. In addition, it
    reached number fourteen on the UK Singles Chart in July
    1972.</p>
