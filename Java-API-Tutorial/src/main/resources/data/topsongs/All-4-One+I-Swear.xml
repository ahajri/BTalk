      <p>"I Swear" is a ballad written by Gary Baker and Frank J.
    Myers that became a hit for two acts in 1994. Initially it was
    a number one song on the U.S. Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks
    chart for John Michael Montgomery at the beginning of the year.
    His version crossed over to pop radio and climbed to #42 on the
    Billboard Hot 100. A few months later, All-4-One covered the
    song and achieved a great success in many countries.</p>
      <p>Several months after John Michael Montgomery had released
    his original version, R&amp;B vocal quartet All-4-One recorded
    their own version with producer David Foster. All-4-One's
    version hit number one in numerous countries, including the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot 100 in the U.S., where it remained for
    eleven consecutive weeks. It peaked at number two on the UK
    Singles Chart and stayed at number two for seven consecutive
    weeks and spent a total of 18 weeks in the chart. The All-4-One
    version was slightly different, in that the line "And when
    there's silver in your hair" from the second verse was replaced
    by "And when just the two of us are there."</p>
      <p>This version was ranked at #78 on 
    <i>Billboard'</i>s Top 100 songs in the 50-year history of the
    Billboard Hot 100 chart.</p>
      <p>In Swedish, two lyrics versions exist. One of them, "Jag
    svär" ("I Swear"), was written by Ingela "Pling" Forsman and
    recorded by Sten &amp; Stanley on the 1995 album 
    <i>Musik, dans &amp; party 10</i>. The other, written by Anica
    Olsson, is called "I dag" ("Today") and was recorded in 1996 by
    Anders Engbergs as 2nd track on the single "Av hela mitt
    hjärta", and by Lotta Engberg and Jarl Carlsson i a duet on
    their 2005 album "Kvinna &amp; man".</p>
      <p>In 2003, American boy-band group B3 covered the song on
    their album 
    <i>N.Y.B3</i>.</p>
      <p>In 1998, a cover version was recorded by four
    cantopop/mandopop singers, Sandy Lam, Prudence Liew, Teresa
    Carpio and Chyi Yu, and was released as a single off Sandy
    Lam's English album "Love is the Only One". The arrangement is
    similar to the All-4-One version.</p>
      <p>In 1995, brazilian duo Leandro &amp; Leonardo covered its
    own version in Portuguese, called "Eu Juro".</p>
