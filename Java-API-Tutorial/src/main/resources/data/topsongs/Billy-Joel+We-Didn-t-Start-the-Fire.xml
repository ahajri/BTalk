      <p>"We Didn't Start the Fire" is a song by Billy Joel that
    makes reference to a catalogue of headline events during his
    lifetime, from March 1949 (Joel was born on May 9 of that year)
    to 1989, when the song was released on his album 
    <i>Storm Front</i>. The events are mixed with a refrain
    asserting "we didn't start the fire". The song was a number-one
    hit in the US.</p>
      <p>The song and music video have been interpreted as a rebuttal
    to criticism of Joel's Baby Boomer generation, from both its
    preceding and succeeding generations. The song's title and
    refrain imply that the frenzied and troubled state which others
    were criticizing had been the state of the world since long
    before his generation's time, but that this was being ignored
    by their critics.</p>
      <p>Joel has a strong interest in history. "I'm a history nut. I
    devour history books. At one time I wanted to be a history
    teacher." According to his mother, he was a bookworm by the age
    of seven. Unlike most of Joel's songs, the lyrics were written
    before the melody, owing to the somewhat unusual style of the
    song. The song was a huge commercial success and was Joel's
    third 
    <i>Billboard</i>#1 hit. It was nominated for the Grammy Award
    for Record of the Year.</p>
      <p>I had turned forty. It was 1989 and I said "Okay, what's
    happened in my life?" I wrote down the year 1949. Okay, Harry
    Truman was president. Popular singer of the day, Doris Day.
    China went Communist. Another popular singer, Johnnie Ray. Big
    Broadway show, 
    <i>South Pacific</i>. Journalist, Walter Winchell. Athlete, Joe
    DiMaggio. Then I went on to 1950 [...]. It's one of the worst
    melodies I've ever written. I kind of like the lyric
    though.</p>
      <p>Although the song ranked #1 in the U.S., and #7 in the UK, 
    <i>Blender</i>magazine ranked "We Didn't Start the Fire" #41 on
    its list of the "50 Worst Songs Ever". "We Didn't Start the
    Fire" also appeared in the same spot on VH1's 
    <i>50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs Ever</i>, a collaboration with 
    <i>Blender</i>in 2004.</p>
      <p>This song could be classified as a patter song characterized
    by its moderately fast tempo with rapid succession of rhythmic
    lyrics.</p>
      <p>A music video for the single was directed by Chris Blum,
    which chronicles a middle-class married couple and their goal
    of the American Dream: a home, careers and children. This is
    juxtaposed with the tumultuous social times of the second half
    of the 20th century (e.g., bra burning). The singer acts as an
    omnipresent observer. During each chorus, Joel beats on a table
    while, in the background, famous photographs (of Lee Harvey
    Oswald's assassination and Nguyễn Văn Lém's execution, among
    others) are consumed by fire.</p>
      <p>Stream of consciousness in style, the song could be
    considered a natural successor to songs such as "Subterranean
    Homesick Blues", "Life Is a Rock (But the Radio Rolled Me)" and
    "It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)", as
    it consists of a series of seemingly unrelated images in a
    rapid-fire, half-spoken, half-sung vocal style.</p>
      <p>Though the lyric is rapid-fire with several people and
    events mentioned in a single word each, there is wide-spread
    agreement on the meaning of the lyric. Steven Ettinger
    wrote,</p>
      <p>The following events are in the order that they appear in
    the song, which is, with two possible exceptions,
    chronological. The lyric for each individual event is brief and
    the events are punctuated by the chorus and other lyrical
    elements. The following list includes longer, more descriptive
    names for clarity. Events from a variety of contexts, such as
    popular entertainment, foreign affairs, and sports, are
    intermingled, giving an impression of the culture of the time
    as a whole. There are 119 items listed in the song.</p>
      <p>(Note that these two items, while later chronologically than
    the two 1976 items, come immediately before them in the
    song.)</p>
      <p>(Note that these two items, while earlier chronologically
    than the two 1977 items, come immediately after them in the
    song)</p>
      <p>Of the 56 individuals mentioned by name in the song, the
    following nine are still alive as of March 2010: Doris Day,
    Queen Elizabeth II, Brigitte Bardot, Fidel Castro, Chubby
    Checker, Bob Dylan, John Glenn, Sally Ride, and Bernhard
    Goetz.</p>
      <p>Johnnie Ray, Joe DiMaggio, Richard Nixon, Roy Campanella,
    Mickey Mantle, Floyd Patterson, Marlon Brando, Menachem Begin,
    Ronald Reagan and J.D. Salinger were all alive when the song
    was released but have died since.</p>
      <p>Two individuals, John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, are
    mentioned by name twice in the song.</p>
      <p>The only U.S. Presidents in office from 1949 to 1989 not
    mentioned in the song are Lyndon Johnson, Gerald Ford and Jimmy
    Carter.</p>
      <p>The Forms recorded a cover of the song for Engine Room
    Recordings' compilation album 
    <i>Guilt by Association Vol. 2</i>, which was released in
    November 2008.</p>
      <p>In 2009, CollegeHumor released a parody of the song on
    video-sharing website YouTube, entitled "We Didn't Start the
    Flame War", referring to flame wars on the Internet, and plays
    in the same style to the song it parodies. As of March 2010,
    over 4.7 million people have watched the video.</p>
