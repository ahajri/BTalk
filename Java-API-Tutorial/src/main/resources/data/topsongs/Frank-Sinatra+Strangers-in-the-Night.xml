      <p>from the album 
    <i>Strangers in the Night</i>
      </p>
      <p>"Strangers in the Night" is a popular song written by
    Charles Singleton, Eddie Snyder and Bert Kaempfert, made famous
    in 1966 by Frank Sinatra.</p>
      <p>Reaching number one on both the Billboard Hot 100 chart and
    the Easy Listening chart, it was the title song for Sinatra's
    1966 album 
    <i>Strangers in the Night</i>, which would become his most
    commercially successful album. The song also reached number one
    on the UK Singles Chart.</p>
      <p>Sinatra's recording won him the Grammy Award for Best Male
    Pop Vocal Performance and the Grammy Award for Record of the
    Year, as well as a Grammy Award for Best Arrangement
    Accompanying a Vocalist or Instrumentalist for Ernie Freeman at
    the Grammy Awards of 1967.</p>
      <p>One of the most memorable and recognizable features of the
    record is Sinatra's scat improvisation of the melody with the
    syllables "doo-be-doo-be-doo" as the song fades to the end.
    This inspired the name for the cartoon canine Scooby Doo. Also
    the fading of the song was made too early, and many fans lament
    the fact that Sinatra's improvisation is cut off too soon. For
    the recently released CD 
    <i>Nothing But The Best</i>, the song was remastered and the
    running time clocks in at 2:44, instead of the usual 2:35. The
    extra nine seconds is just a continuation of Sinatra's scat
    noises.</p>
      <p>The track was recorded on April 11, 1966, one month before
    the rest of the album.</p>
      <p>The English lyrics were written by Charles Singleton and
    Eddie Snyder. The music was originally recorded by Ivo Robić
    for the music festival in St. Petersburg, Russia. Robić later
    sang the song in German ("
    <span lang="de">Fremde in der Nacht</span>",
    lyrics by Kurt Felitz) and Croatian ("
    <span lang="hr">Stranci u Noći</span>", lyrics by
    Marija Renota). A thorough adaptation and an arrangement of the
    piece was done for Sinatra's version by Bert Kaempfert (who had
    included an instrumental version in his score for the film 
    <i>A Man Could Get Killed</i>); however, this adaptation was
    taken to court in 1966 by composer Ralph Chicorel, who claimed
    that 24 of "Strangers"' 32 bars had been copied from his song,
    "You Are My Love." Chicorel's song, "You Are My Love", was the
    title tune of a 12-song 1965 LP demo, submitted to both Sinatra
    and Jack Jones' record companies through the Detroit, Michigan
    distributor of their labels in 1966. (Jones would record his
    own rendition of "Strangers" that year.) Also claiming
    composing rights was Kaempfert's colleague at the time, Herbert
    Rehbein. The case was settled out of court after years of
    Kaempfert not showing up to court dates. Chicorel still claims
    that "true justice" has not been served as the song's success
    and "wrongful attribution" were not made up for in the
    settlement.</p>
      <p>Sinatra despised the song and called it "a piece of shit,"
    and "the worst fucking song I ever heard."</p>
