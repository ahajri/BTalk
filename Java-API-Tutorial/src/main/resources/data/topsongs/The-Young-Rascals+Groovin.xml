      <p>"Groovin'" is a single released in 1967 by The Young Rascals
    that became a number-one hit and one of the group's signature
    songs.</p>
      <p>Written by group members Felix Cavaliere and Eddie Brigati
    and with a lead vocal from Cavaliere, it is indeed a slow,
    relaxed groove, based on Cavaliere's newfound interest in
    Afro-Cuban music. Instrumentation included a conga, harmonica,
    and an effective, Cuban-based bass guitar line from ace session
    musician Chuck Rainey. The result was fairly different from the
    Rascals' white soul origins, enough so that Atlantic Records
    head Jerry Wexler did not want to release "Groovin'".</p>
      <p>Lyrically, "Groovin'" is themed around a highly romantic
    portrayal of a couple in love:</p>
      <p>The single became an instant hit in May 1967, bounding up
    the charts and then spending four weeks atop the Billboard pop
    singles chart. It was RIAA-certified a gold record on June 13,
    1967. Showing it (and the group's) crossover appeal, it also
    reached number 3 on the Billboard Black Songs chart chart .
    "Groovin" was soon recorded by the likes of Booker T. &amp; the
    M.G.'s (1967), Petula Clark (1967), Aretha Franklin (1968),
    Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips (1968), Willie Mitchell (1969),
    and Marvin Gaye (1969). Finally, "Groovin'" was the only real
    hit the group ever had in the United Kingdom, reaching number 8
    on the UK Singles Chart.</p>
      <p>"Groovin'" was subsequently included on The Young Rascals'
    late July 1967 album 
    <i>Groovin'</i>, but with a different harmonica riff.</p>
      <p>"Groovin'" is one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500
    Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll, and is also the recipient of a
    Grammy Hall of Fame Award.</p>
      <p>Co-writer Eddie Brigati and his brother David, as the group
    Brigati, recorded a dance version of "Groovin'" for their 1976
    album 
    <i>Lost in the Wilderness</i>after Eddie left the Rascals.</p>
      <p>Two decades later, "Groovin'" was recorded by Pato Banton
    and it became a top 20 hit in the UK for him in 1996.</p>
