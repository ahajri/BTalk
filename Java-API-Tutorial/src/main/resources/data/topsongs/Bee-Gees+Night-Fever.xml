      <p>"Night Fever", is a disco song, written and performed by The
    Bee Gees. It first appeared on the soundtrack to 
    <i>Saturday Night Fever</i>. Producer Robert Stigwood wanted to
    call the film 
    <i>Saturday Night</i>, but singer Robin Gibb expressed
    hesitation at the title. Stigwood liked the title 
    <i>Night Fever</i>but was wary of marketing a movie with that
    name. He combined the two suggestions and the idea for 
    <i>Saturday Night Fever</i>as a motion picture was born.</p>
      <p>"Night Fever" remained the number one Billboard Hot 100
    single for over two months in 1978. It also replaced Andy
    Gibb's "Love Is Thicker Than Water" at number one, and was in
    turn replaced by Yvonne Elliman's "If I Can't Have You" - all
    of which were written and produced by the Gibb brothers.</p>
      <p>After the success of "Night Fever," the Governor of Florida,
    Reubin O'Donovan Askew, made the three men "honorary citizens"
    of the state, due to the amount of time they spent each year
    recording singles in Miami.</p>
      <p>In addition to Saturday Night Fever, the song has also
    appeared in the movie and on the soundtrack for Mystery
    Men.</p>
      <p>A rare music video was made for the song in 1978, however it
    wasn't shown to the public until 2004 despite the fact the
    video didn't contain any uncensored content. It features the
    brothers singing the song in a dark studio cut with images from
    New York City streets. An interesting note, in the video Barry
    Gibb was shown without his trademark beard.</p>
      <p>The song lists at #33 on 
    <i>Billboard's All Time Top 100.</i>[1]</p>
      <p>Texan punk rock band The Dicks covered this song on the
    B-side of their 1980 debut single "Hate the Police" under the
    title "All Night Fever".</p>
      <p>In 2008, Australian singer and songwriter Tina Arena
    performed a cover version of "Night Fever" for the French film 
    <i>Disco</i>.</p>
