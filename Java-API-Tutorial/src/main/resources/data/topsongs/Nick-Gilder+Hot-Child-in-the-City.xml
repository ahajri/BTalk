      <p>After seeing young girls on Hollywood and Sunset Boulevard,
    it inspired Gilder to write this song, he explained, “
    <i>There are young people around (downtown Los Angeles) and
    finding out about themselves. And so it was really a
    reflection, I think, of youthful angst and the passion that you
    feel when you are young, to find out what it’s all about in
    this world</i>.” Quote appears in 
    <i>Interview</i>, 
    <i>Question 1</i>[1].</p>
