      <p>"Can't Nobody Hold Me Down" is a hip-hop song by Sean "Puff
    Daddy" Combs featuring Mase. It appears on Combs' debut album 
    <i>No Way Out</i>and it was released as the first single in
    1997.</p>
      <p>Combs was already a successful songwriter, producer and
    record label owner (Bad Boy Records) before he released his
    debut album as a performer. His first U.S. chart single, "No
    Time", was a top-twenty hit for Lil' Kim on which Puff Daddy
    was credited as a featured vocalist. "Can't Nobody Hold Me
    Down" was the debut chart appearance for Harlem-based rapper
    Mase.</p>
      <p>The song combines elements of several previous singles, the
    most obvious being a slowed-down rhythm track sampled from
    Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's "The Message". The
    track's chorus is an interpolation of "Break My Stride", a
    top-five single by Matthew Wilder from 1983.</p>
      <p>"Can't Nobody Hold Me Down" entered the U.S. Billboard Hot
    100 at number thirty-two in early 1997 and eventually spent six
    weeks at number one. It was the beginning of Combs' and Bad Boy
    Records' chart domination during the year â€” the Combs-produced
    "Hypnotize" by The Notorious B.I.G. would follow this song at
    number one, and the B.I.G. tribute song "I'll Be Missing You"
    spent eleven weeks at number one during the summer, only to be
    followed by another B.I.G. song, "Mo Money Mo Problems" and
    then the Combs-produced "Honey" by Mariah Carey.</p>
      <p>The albums from Combs, Mase, B.I.G. and Carey would also
    dominate the top slots of the Billboard 200 during this time as
    well.</p>
      <p>The packaging for the single stated that the song was from
    the upcoming album 
    <i>Hell Up in Harlem</i>, retitled as 
    <i>No Way Out</i>prior to its release.</p>
