      <p>"Kiss You All Over" is a number one single in the United
    States during 1978 by the group Exile. It was included on the
    band's album 
    <i>Mixed Emotions</i>, and it featured primarily the late Jimmy
    Stokley on lead vocals (although guitarist J.P. Pennington also
    had some lead vocal parts). This song proved to be Exile's only
    big hit in the pop rock market; Stokley left the band in 1979,
    and the remaining members took a decidedly more country
    direction with the dawning of the 1980s.</p>
      <p>The song appeared in the 1996 Adam Sandler film 
    <i>Happy Gilmore</i>. It was also used in 2007 on CBC's 
    <i>Hockey Night In Canada</i>during a montage of Stanley Cup
    celebrations at the conclusion of the final game of the Stanley
    Cup Playoffs.</p>
      <p>The song was also featured in the Andy Kaufman biopic, 
    <i>Man on the Moon</i>, in the scene where Andy visits some
    prostitutes, and in the 2006 comedy 
    <i>Employee of the Month</i>in a scene which Dax Shepard and
    Efren Ramirez are listening to the song and end up discussing
    it.</p>
