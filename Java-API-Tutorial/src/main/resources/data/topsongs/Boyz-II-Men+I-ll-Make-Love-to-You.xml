      <p>"I'll Make Love to You" is a 1994 number-one hit single by
    R&amp;B group Boyz II Men for the Motown label. The song, which
    was written by Babyface, was the lead single from their second
    album 
    <i>II</i>. It was at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for 14
    weeks, from August 27 to November 26, 1994. The song set a
    record for the most weeks at number one at the time (tied with
    Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You" from late 1992 to
    early 1993). This record was later broken by "One Sweet Day", a
    collaboration between Boyz II Men and Mariah Carey, which
    remained at #1 on the Hot 100 for 16 weeks. "I'll Make Love To
    You" also topped the U.S. R&amp;B and adult contemporary charts
    in 1994, and the single went Top 5 in the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>A platinum-selling single, "I'll Make Love to You" won the
    1995 Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or
    Group with Vocals and two American Music Awards for Favorite
    Pop/Rock Single and Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Single.</p>
      <p>The song is featured on the video game 
    <i>Karaoke Revolution Volume 2</i>.</p>
      <p>The song ranks at #17 on 
    <i>Billboard's All Time Top 100.</i>[1]</p>
      <p>The music video features a woman and a man. The man, whose
    name is Dwayne, installs a security system in the woman's
    house. She later invites him to have a drink, but he's busy. It
    turns out that she really likes him, likewise as he likes her
    too. In the end, he writes her a letter, she receives it and
    reads it: it is a love letter, with the song lyrics.</p>
      <p>Throughout the video, Boyz II Men appear in two sets of
    white and beige clothes, white shorts and pastels over white
    muscle shirts, shorts and track jackets over t-shirts with
    green canvas shoes and no socks, dress pants and chest-bearing
    open dress shirts, colorful suits with muscle shirts
    underneath, all in different areas and landscapes.</p>
