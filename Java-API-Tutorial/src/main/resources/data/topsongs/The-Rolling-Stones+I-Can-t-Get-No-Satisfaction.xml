      <p>"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" is a song by English rock
    band The Rolling Stones released in 1965. It was written by
    Mick Jagger and Keith Richards and produced by Andrew Loog
    Oldham. The number is noted for Richards's three-note guitar
    riff which opens and drives the song, and for the lyrics, which
    include references to sexual intercourse and a theme of
    anti-commercialism. The latter in particular caused the song to
    be "perceived as an attack on the status quo".</p>
      <p>The song was first released as a single in the United States
    in June 1965 and also featured on the American version of 
    <i>Out of Our Heads</i>, released that July. "Satisfaction" was
    a hit, giving the Stones their first number one in the United
    States. In Europe, the song initially played only on pirate
    radio stations because its lyrics were considered too sexually
    suggestive. In Britain the single was released in August 1965;
    it became the Rolling Stones' fourth UK number one. The song is
    considered to be one of the all-time great rock songs. In 2004 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>magazine placed "Satisfaction" in the
    second spot on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time,
    while in 2006 it was added to the Library of Congress National
    Recording Registry.</p>
      <p>Keith Richards states that he came up with the guitar riff
    for the song in his sleep, waking up in the middle of the
    night, recording the riff and the words "I can't get no
    satisfaction" on a cassette recorder and promptly falling back
    to sleep. He would later describe the tape as: "two minutes of
    'Satisfaction' and 40 minutes of me snoring." He and Jagger
    finished writing the song at the Jack Tar Harrison Hotel in
    Clearwater, Florida, in May 1965. Jagger wrote most of the
    lyrics - a statement about the rampant commercialism that the
    Rolling Stones had seen in America.</p>
      <p>Richards was concerned that the riff sounded too much like
    Martha and the Vandellas' "Dancing in the Street". Jagger later
    said: "It sounded like a folk song when we first started
    working on it and Keith didn't like it much, he didn't want it
    to be a single, he didn't think it would do very well... I
    think Keith thought it was a bit basic. I don't think he really
    listened to it properly. He was too close to it and just felt
    it was a silly kind of riff." Jagger has also pointed out that
    the title lyrics closely resemble a line from Chuck Berry's "30
    Days". (Berry's lyric is "If I 
    <i>don't</i>get no satisfaction from the judge".)</p>
      <p>The Rolling Stones first recorded the track on 10 May 1965
    at Chess Studios in Chicago - a version featuring Brian Jones
    on harmonica. The group re-recorded it two days later at RCA
    Studios in Hollywood, with a different beat and the Gibson
    Maestro fuzzbox adding sustain to the sound of the guitar riff.
    Richards envisioned redoing the track later with a horn section
    playing the riff: "this was just a little sketch, because, to
    my mind, the fuzz tone was really there to denote what the
    horns would be doing." The other Rolling Stones, as well as
    manager Andrew Loog Oldham and sound engineer Dave Hassinger
    eventually outvoted Richards and the track was selected for
    release as a single. The song's success boosted sales of the
    Gibson fuzzbox so that the entire available stock sold out by
    the end of 1965.</p>
      <p>Like most of the Stones' pre-1966 recordings, "Satisfaction"
    was originally released in mono only. In the mid-1980s, a true
    stereo version of the song was released on German and Japanese
    editions of the CD reissue of 
    <i>Hot Rocks 1964-1971</i>. The stereo mix features a piano
    (played by session player Jack Nitzsche) and acoustic guitar
    that are barely audible in the original mono release (both
    instruments are also audible on a bootleg recording of the
    instrumental track). This stereo mix of "Satisfaction" also
    appeared on a radio-promo CD of rare stereo tracks provided to
    US radio stations in the mid-1980s, but has not yet been
    featured on a worldwide commercial CD; even later pressings of
    the German and Japanese 
    <i>Hot Rocks</i>CDs feature the mono mix, making the earlier
    releases with the stereo mix collectors' items. For the
    worldwide 2002 reissue of 
    <i>Hot Rocks</i>, an alternate quasi-stereo mix was used
    featuring the lead guitar, bass, drums, and vocals in the
    center channel and the acoustic guitar and piano "split" left
    and right via a delay effect.</p>
      <p>"Satisfaction" was released as a single in the US by London
    Records on 6 June 1965, with "The Under-Assistant West Coast
    Promotion Man" as its B-side. The single made its way through
    the American charts, reaching the top on 10 July, displacing
    The Four Tops' "I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)".
    "Satisfaction" held on for a full four weeks, being knocked off
    on 7 August by "I'm Henery the Eighth, I Am" from Herman's
    Hermits. The song entered the Hot 100 charts in America in the
    week ending 12 June 1965, remaining there for 14 weeks; it was
    #1 for four straight weeks. While in its eighth week on the
    American charts, the single was certified a gold record award
    by the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) for
    selling more than half a million copies in the United States,
    giving the band their first of many gold disc awards in
    America. Later the song was also released by London Records on 
    <i>Out of Our Heads</i>in America. According to "Joel Whitburn
    Presents, Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942â€“2004", the song
    also reached #19 on the Top Selling Rhythm and Blues
    Singles.</p>
      <p>"Satisfaction" was not immediately released by Decca Records
    in Great Britain. Decca was already in the process of preparing
    a live Rolling Stones EP for release, so the new single didn't
    come out in Britain until 20 August, with "The Spider and the
    Fly" on the B-Side. The song peaked at number one for two
    weeks, replacing Sonny &amp; Cher's "I Got You Babe", between
    11 September and 25 September, before being toppled by The
    Walker Brothers' "Make It Easy on Yourself".</p>
      <p>In the decades since its release, "Satisfaction" has
    repeatedly been acclaimed by the music industry. In 1976,
    Britain's 
    <i>New Musical Express</i>listed "Satisfaction" 7th among the
    top 100 singles of all time. There was a resurgence of interest
    in the song after it was prominently featured in the 1979 movie
    
    <i>Apocalypse Now.</i>In 1991, Vox listed "Satisfaction" among
    "100 records that shook the world". In 1999, BMI named
    "Satisfaction" as the 91st-most performed song of the 20th
    century. In 2000, VH1 listed "Satisfaction" first among its
    "Top 100 Greatest Rock Songs"; the same year, "Satisfaction"
    also finished runner-up to "Yesterday" in a list jointly
    compiled by 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>and MTV. In 2003, 
    <i>Q</i>placed the song 68th out of its "1001 Best Songs Ever".
    In 2004, 
    <i>Rolling Stone'</i>s panel of judges named "Satisfaction" as
    the second-greatest song of all time, coming in second to Bob
    Dylan's "Like a Rolling Stone". 
    <i>Newsweek</i>has called the opening riff "five notes that
    shook the world".</p>
      <p>Jagger has said of "Satisfaction": "It was the song that
    really made The Rolling Stones, changed us from just another
    band into a huge, monster band... It has a very catchy title.
    It has a very catchy guitar riff. It has a great guitar sound,
    which was original at that time. And it captures a spirit of
    the times, which is very important in those kinds of songs...
    Which was alienation." Richards claimed that the song's riff
    could be heard in half of the songs that The Rolling Stones had
    produced, saying that "there is only one song â€” it's just the
    variations you come up with."</p>
      <p>The song has become a staple at Rolling Stones shows. They
    have performed it on nearly every tour since its release, and
    concert renditions have been included on the albums 
    <i>Got Live if You Want It!</i>, 
    <i>Still Life (American Concert 1981)</i>, 
    <i>Flashpoint</i>, 
    <i>Live Licks</i>and 
    <i>Shine a Light</i>. One unusual rendition is included in
    Robert Frank's film 
    <i>Cocksucker Blues</i>from the 1972 tour, when the song was
    performed by both the Rolling Stones and Stevie Wonder's band
    as the second half of a medley with Wonder's "Uptight".</p>
      <p>The song opens with the guitar riff, which is joined by the
    bass halfway through. It is repeated three times with the drums
    and acoustic guitar before the vocal enters with the line: "I
    can't get no satisfaction". The title line is an example of a
    double negative resolving to a negative, a common usage in
    colloquial English. Jagger sings the verses in a tone hovering
    between cynical commentary and frustrated protest, and then
    leaps half singing and half yelling into the chorus, where the
    guitar riff reappears. The lyrics outline the singer's
    irritation with the increasing commercialism of the modern
    world, where the radio broadcasts "useless information" and a
    man on television tells him "how white my shirts can be - but
    he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke the same cigarettes
    as me." Jagger also describes the stress of being a celebrity,
    and the tensions of touring. The reference in the verse to not
    getting any "girl reaction" was fairly controversial in its
    day, interpreted by some listeners (and radio programmers) as
    meaning a girl willing to have sex. Particularly shocking to
    some people was a reference to a girl having her period (being
    "on a losing streak"). The song closes with a fairly subdued
    repetition of the song's title, followed suddenly by a full
    shout of the line, with the final words repeated into the
    fade-out.</p>
      <p>In its day the song was perceived as disturbing because of
    both its sexual connotations and the negative view of
    commercialism and other aspects of modern culture; critic Paul
    Gambaccini stated: "The lyrics to this were truly threatening
    to an older audience. This song was perceived as an attack on
    the status quo". When the Rolling Stones performed the song on 
    <i>Shindig!</i>in 1965, the line "trying to make some girl" was
    censored. Forty years later, when the band performed three
    songs during the February 2006 Super Bowl XL halftime show,
    "Satisfaction" was the only one of the three songs not censored
    as it was broadcast.</p>
      <p>"Satisfaction" was released as a 7-inch single by The
    Residents in 1976. It is a complete reworking of The Rolling
    Stones's version. The Residents' version features extreme
    guitar noise (courtesy of friend and guest guitarist
    Snakefinger), distorted, screamed vocals, and altered
    lyrics.</p>
      <p>The original 1976 release was packaged in a silkscreened
    sleeve, released in a limited edition of 200. The song proved
    popular, and was re-released in 1978 with a standard picture
    sleeve, on yellow vinyl and in a regular release of 30,000
    copies. The song proved popular in the United Kingdom,
    especially since the re-release came at the peak of the UK punk
    movement.</p>
      <p>On the album 
    <i>Eat Exuding Oinks</i>, which is a CD release of a radio
    special about the music of The Residents, the song was
    described by both the radio DJ Sid Powell and Jay Clem as the
    "most determinedly repulsive song" ever recorded.</p>
      <p>The American New Wave band Devo released their rendition of
    "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" as a single in 1977.</p>
      <p>Gerald Casale has stated that Mick Jagger's assertion that
    he liked Devo's rendition was "a setup", and that a Warner
    Bros. lawyer had asked him to approve the cover. Steve Huey of
    Allmusic stated that the cover version "reworks the original's
    alienation into a spastic freak-out that's nearly
    unrecognizable".</p>
      <p>The quirky music video for this song and several others from
    this album received significant airplay on the upstart MTV. The
    video appears on Devo's home videos, 
    <i>The Men Who Make the Music</i>, 
    <i>We're All Devo</i>and 
    <i>The Complete Truth About De-Evolution</i>. A notable feature
    of the video was dancer Craig Allen Rothwell, known as Spazz
    Attack, whose signature dance move, a forward flip onto his
    back, drew him significant attention. He later appeared in the
    music video for Devo's 
    <i>Peek-A-Boo</i>, and on David Bowie's Glass Spider tour.</p>
      <p>In late 1999, Jive Records obtained the license for Britney
    Spears to cover the song for her upcoming 2000 second album, 
    <i>Oops!...I Did It Again</i>. Spears re-recorded the song in a
    pop/teen pop style version in late February 2000 at Hollywood's
    Pacifique Recording Studios. The sessions took place right
    after the 42nd Grammy Awards held on February 23, 2000. They
    ran from February 24 to February 26, 2000. Though the song was
    never released as a promotional or commercial single, Spears
    did perform the song at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards as an
    intro before she went into performing her hit single, "Oops!...
    I Did It Again".</p>
