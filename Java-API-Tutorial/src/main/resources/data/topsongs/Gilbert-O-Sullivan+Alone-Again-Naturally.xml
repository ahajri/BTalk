      <p>"Alone Again (Naturally)" is a song by Irish
    singer–songwriter Gilbert O'Sullivan. It was released in 1972,
    and in total spent six weeks, non-consecutively, at #1 on the
    United States Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. In Casey Kasem's
    American 'Top 40 of the 1970s', "Alone Again (Naturally)" was
    #5 (Debby Boone's "You Light Up My Life" was #1). The track
    reached #3 in the UK Singles Chart.</p>
      <p>It is an introspective ballad, starting with the singer
    telling of his plans to commit suicide after being left at the
    altar, and then telling about the death of his parents.
    O'Sullivan has said that the song is not autobiographical, as
    he did not know his father (who died when O'Sullivan was 11)
    very well, and that his father had mistreated his mother.
    "Alone Again (Naturally)" is included on O'Sullivan's 
    <i>The Berry Vest of Gilbert O'Sullivan</i>album (2004) on the
    EMI record label. Big Jim Sullivan plays the guitar break in
    the original recorded version of the song.</p>
      <p>The landmark 1991 copyright case 
    <i>Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records
    Inc.</i>centered on the unauthorized use of a sample from
    "Alone Again (Naturally)" by rapper Biz Markie.</p>
      <p>The song has been featured in a handful of movies and TV
    shows, including 
    <i>Summer Time Machine Blues</i>, 
    <i>Stuart Little 2</i>, 
    <i>The Virgin Suicides</i>and 
    <i>Stuck on You</i>. It was also the opening theme song of
    episode 24 of the Japanese anime 
    <i>Maison Ikkoku</i>(Sullivan's later hit "Get Down" was the
    closing theme of that same episode, but the producers were
    unable to use the songs for more than one episode due to
    copyright problems).</p>
      <p>In 1972, the Dutch comedy duo Van Kooten en De Bie wrote a
    Dutch version of the song, called 
    <i>1948</i>. It deals about nostalgic feelings of a sober, but
    happy childhood in the year 1948, just three years after World
    War II.</p>
      <p>Dame Shirley Bassey covered the song on her 1976 album 
    <i>Love, Life, and Feelings</i>.</p>
      <p>In 2004, Ehud Manor wrote a Hebrew version of the song. This
    version is called "VeShuv Levad" (Hebrew: 
    <span lang="he" dir="rtl">"ושוב לבד"</span>‎,
    "Alone Again"), and sung by Tiki Dayan, an Israeli actress. The
    Hebrew version was used as the theme song for the Israeli drama
    series 
    <i>Matay Nitnashek</i>, in 2007.</p>
      <p>In the season 17 episode of 
    <i>The Simpsons</i>, "The Wettest Stories Ever Told", Comic
    Book Guy uses it as inspirational music. During the second
    series of the British television drama 
    <i>Life on Mars</i>, it is used as an end theme of one episode
    to signify the despair of the lead character, Sam Tyler.</p>
      <p>In May 2000, a cover of the song appeared on 
    <i>Diet for a New America</i>by 58 - a side project by Motley
    Crue's Nikki Sixx. The song was covered in 2005 by Elton John
    and the Pet Shop Boys for a rare 2005 promo of Gilbert
    O'Sullivan. This cover version was never released
    commercially.</p>
      <p>Cass Elliot also covered song live.</p>
      <p>The song was also used in 
    <i>Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs</i>, the lyrics were changed
    to be more humorous and romantic.</p>
