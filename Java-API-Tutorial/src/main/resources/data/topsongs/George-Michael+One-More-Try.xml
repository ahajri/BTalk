      <p>"One More Try" is a U.S. number-one hit song written and
    performed by George Michael and released by Epic Records in
    1988 as the fourth single from 
    <i>Faith</i>.</p>
      <p>The song was the fourth of six singles to be released from
    George's debut solo album 
    <i>Faith</i>. A ballad at six minutes in length, the song
    lyrically explored Michael's unwillingness to return to a new
    relationship because he had been emotionally hurt so many times
    previously. The song concludes with temptation taking over, and
    Michael ends by singing the title for the only time.</p>
      <p>"One More Try" remained a live favourite at Michael's
    concerts in the years which followed, although its radio
    airplay tends to be restricted to specific "Love Songs"-esque
    features because of both the tempo and the length.</p>
      <p>It reached #8 in the UK Singles Chart but became his seventh
    #1 on the Hot 100 in the USA. Four of the six singles issued
    from 
    <i>Faith</i>went to number one in America, while by comparison,
    none managed to do so in the UK.</p>
      <p>"One More Try" was the third consecutive #1 single from the 
    <i>Faith</i>album. "One More Try" debuted at an impressive #40
    the week of April 16, 1988, and matching the speed of "Father
    Figure", reached #1 by its seventh week, May 28, 1988, this
    time staying there for three consecutive weeks. "One More Try"
    was the second-longest running #1 of 1988, tied with "Every
    Rose Has Its Thorn" by Poison, and behind the four-week run of
    Steve Winwood's "Roll With It". In total, "One More Try" spent
    7 weeks in the Top 10 and 14 weeks in the Top 40 of the
    Billboard Hot 100. "One More Try" was the last number-one
    single on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart by a white male
    artist until Robin Thicke's "Lost Without U" (2007).</p>
      <p>In total, "One More Try" hit number one on:</p>
      <p>which made it the first single in the history of 
    <i>Billboard</i>to reach #1 on three different charts in the
    United States.</p>
      <p>"One More Try" Maxi CD</p>
      <p>In 1999, R&amp;B teen trio Divine recorded the song as their
    second single off their debut album 
    <i>Fairy Tales</i>.</p>
