      <p>"Love You Inside Out" is a 1979 hit single for the Bee Gees,
    from their album 
    <i>Spirits Having Flown</i>. It reached number one on the
    Billboard Hot 100 for one week in June 1979 (interrupting Donna
    Summer's "Hot Stuff"). It would be the ninth and final
    number-one hit for the Bee Gees in the US.</p>
      <p>Like their other big hits of disco era, this song also
    contained the falsetto vocal style of Bee Gees.</p>
      <p>It has been covered by Leslie Feist (under the title "Inside
    and Out") on her 2004 album 
    <i>Let It Die</i>and was sampled a few years before by R&amp;B
    group Total on the album track "When Boy Meets Girl" from their
    self-titled debut in 1996. The sample was included on R Kelly
    and Jay-Z's hit song "Honey". It was also sampled by Snoop Dogg
    for his rap single "Ups and Downs" in 2005 and on rap group
    Nemesis' hit "Cantfiguritout."</p>
