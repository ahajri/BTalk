      <p>"Get Down Tonight" is a song released in 1975 on the
    eponymous album by the disco group KC and the Sunshine Band.
    The song became widely successful, becoming the first of their
    five number-one hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It also
    reached the top of the Hot Soul Singles chart.</p>
      <p>The song displays some of the signature characteristics of
    the disco era such as a fast tempo, and repeating lyrics. The
    song features a distinctive introduction, in which a recorded
    guitar solo is rendered at double speed over a normal-speed
    guitar line in the background.</p>
      <p>Richard Finch told Songfacts that "Get Down Tonight" was
    inspired by a Gilbert O'Sullivan song called "Get Down." He
    explained: "He wrote that song about his dog. That record was
    really hot back then. And I was like, 'Okay, this guy has a
    great idea.' He's talking about 'get down.' But I didn't find
    out until later on he was talking about his dog. And I was
    like, 'Well, that's really square.' How hip is that?"</p>
      <p>In 1998 the song was sampled by the house production act
    Bamboo for the hit single "Bamboogie". It peaked at Number 2 in
    the UK Singles Chart.</p>
      <p>The song was also featured in the medley-song 
    <i>"Hey Goldmember"</i>(from the 2002 motion picture 
    <i>"Austin Powers in Goldmember"</i>) along with Earth, Wind
    &amp; Fire's 
    <i>"Sing A Song"</i>and two other KC &amp; the Sunshine Band's
    songs, namely 
    <i>"(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty"</i>and 
    <i>"That's the Way (I Like It)"</i>. The lyrics of all four
    songs have been changed completely, and the song is performed
    by Foxxy Cleopatra, one of the movie's main characters,
    portrayed by Beyonc√© Knowles. The song also appeared in the
    movie Sid and Nancy which was based on the life of Sid Vicious
    and Nancy Spungen</p>
