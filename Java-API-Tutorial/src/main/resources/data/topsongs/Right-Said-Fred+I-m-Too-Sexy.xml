      <p>"I'm Too Sexy" is a song by English trio Right Said Fred
    from their album 
    <i>Up</i>. The single topped the American charts for three
    weeks in early 1992, after having peaked at number two in
    Britain less than six months earlier.</p>
      <p>In the UK, the song set a new record for the most weeks at
    number two without ever topping the chart, staying at number
    two for six weeks in a row while being famously held off the
    summit by Bryan Adams' "Everything I Do (I Do It For You)",
    beating the previous record set by Ultravox's 1981 release
    "Vienna", which stayed at number two for four weeks.</p>
      <p>"I'm Too Sexy" is sung from the point of view of a
    self-satisfied fashion model. The song's lyrics express
    (over)confidence that his personal level of sexiness makes him
    too sexy for numerous things, most notably his shirt. The
    song's instrumental break is based on the guitar riff in the
    Jimi Hendrix song "Third Stone from the Sun".</p>
      <p>A new version of the song called "I'm Too Sexy 2007",
    produced by the Tastemakers, was released in April 2007.
    Besides being an updated production it differs from the
    original version by no longer using "Third Stone from the Sun"
    in its instrumental break. A new video was released as well
    although there is also a version where the original song from
    1992 is used with the updated video.</p>
      <p>The re-release of the song was prompted by a "Cleaner Close"
    advertising campaign for Daz detergent. This featured both
    Fairbrass brothers and included a self-parody of the song
    called "I'm too sexy for my whites". For this occasion they
    renamed the band "White Said Fred".</p>
      <p>The original song itself was rated #49 on 
    <i>"It's the 50 Worst Songs Ever! Watch, Listen and
    Cringe!"</i>by 
    <i>Blender</i>.</p>
      <p>The band is considered a one-hit wonder in the United
    States, its only other charting U.S. single peaking at #76.
    However, "I'm Too Sexy" was just the act's first of several
    hits on the British charts, including the No. 1 single "Deeply
    Dippy."</p>
      <p>The following is a list, in lyrical order, of the things for
    which the model considers himself to be too sexy:</p>
      <p>U.S. single</p>
      <p>Notes:</p>
      <p>Saint Etienne, MC Hammer, Crazy Frog, and Alvin and the
    Chipmunks have all covered the song. Jos√© Feliciano has also
    parodied it in his concerts.</p>
      <p>Rupert Everett covered this song for an end scene in the
    film 
    <i>Shrek 2</i>.</p>
      <p>Also the chew sweet Fruitella used a variation on the songs
    lyrics for a series of adverts in 1992 where a young child
    claims he is "too fruity" or "too juicy" for things as opposed
    to being too attractive,; this spin continued until 1995
    although from 1994 onwards the advert theme was changed to
    revolve around the Salt n Pepa single "Let's Talk about
    Sex".</p>
      <p>The 2009 Sugababes single "Get Sexy" samples "I'm Too Sexy",
    it also uses the phrase 
    <i>so sexy it hurts</i>in its chorus.</p>
