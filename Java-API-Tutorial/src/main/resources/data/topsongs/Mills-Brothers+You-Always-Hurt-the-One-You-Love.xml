      <p>"You Always Hurt the One You Love" is a pop standard,
    written by Allan Roberts and Doris Fisher. It has been
    performed by many artists over the years, such as The Mills
    Brothers, Connie Francis (#13 on the UK Singles Chart in 1959),

    Chamberlain (as the b-side of his single "Rome Will Never Leave
    You"), Peggy Lee, Maureen Evans, Michael Bubl√©, Kay Starr, Hank
    Thompson, Ringo Starr (in his 1970 album ), and Clarence
    "Frogman" Henry, whose version became a top twenty hit on the
    Billboard Hot 100 in 1961. It was also popular in a parody
    version by Spike Jones.</p>
      <p>The recording by The Mills Brothers was released by Decca
    Records as catalog number 18599. It first reached the Billboard
