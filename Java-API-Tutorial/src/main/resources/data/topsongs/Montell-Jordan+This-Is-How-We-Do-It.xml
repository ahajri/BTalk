      <p>"This Is How We Do It" is a 1995 song by American R&amp;B
    singer Montell Jordan. This song, Jordan's first single, is
    representative of the new jack swing style popular at the time,
    featuring Jordan singing over an enhanced sample of Slick
    Rick's "Children's Story." "This is How We Do It" was
    number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 for seven weeks from April
    15 to May 27, 1995, and was number one for seven weeks on the
    R&amp;B singles chart. Montell Jordan made history as he became
    the first male artist to have a debut single reach #1 on the
    Hot 100.</p>
      <p>The song has appeared on many dance compilations, including 
    <i>Jock Jams volume 2</i>, for example. When played on Top 40
    radio, the song's rap bridge is often edited out. The song
    ranked #95 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the 90s.</p>
      <p>"This Is How We Do It" can be heard in numerous films,
    including 
    <i>The Nutty Professor</i>, 
    <i>To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday</i>, 
    <i>Multiplicity</i>, 
    <i>How High</i>, 
    <i>8 Mile</i>, 
    <i>Ali G Indahouse</i>(covered by Mis-teeq), and
