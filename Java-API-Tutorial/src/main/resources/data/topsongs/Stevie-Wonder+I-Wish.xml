      <p>"I Wish" is a hit disco song by Stevie Wonder. It was
    released in 1976 as a single and included on the album 
    <i>Songs in the Key of Life</i>. Written and produced by
    Wonder, the song focuses on his childhood. The single hit
    number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and soul singles chart.</p>
      <p>The song evolves around an 8 note bass line, which is
    repeated throughout the whole song (although the specific
    octave of the bass line does change). The key of the piece,
    like several other of Wonder's hits, is E♭ Minor, although the
    bridge of the piece is slightly different. The keyboard part
    consists of two chords during the chorus and verse: E-flat
    minor 7th (third inversion) and A-flat 7 (first inversion).
    Stevie Wonder also created a multi-layered monophonic
    synthesizer part which runs through the song's entirety.
    Throughout the chorus and verse, this varied Minor pentatonic
    scale (which can be played using just the black notes on a
    keyboard) is repeated and adds depth to the song. This piece
    has a syncopated horn section, as well.</p>
      <p>In the TV series Classic Albums, Wonder recreated a small
    section from the song to demonstrate how he composed and
    arranged it. He played the keyboards and drums himself, and
    used most of the musicians that appeared on the original
    recording.</p>
      <p>In 1999, Will Smith recorded "Wild Wild West", a hip-hop
    song that sampled the instrumental track from "I Wish". Wonder
    also appeared in the music video of the song, which was
    featured on the soundtrack to the 1999 film, 
    <i>Wild Wild West</i>.</p>
      <p>This song was also covered by the a capella group Vox One,
    on their album 
    <i>Pure Imagination</i>.</p>
      <p>Another cover of the song was done by Randy Coven, Al
    Pitrelli and John O'Reilly for their 1992 album 
    <i>C.P.R.</i>, with a young Zakk Wylde on vocals. Céline Dion
    also performs this song in her Las Vegas show "A New
    Day...".</p>
      <p>The song is covered by Patti LaBelle, Fantasia and Yolanda
    Adams for the Warner Bros. animated movie 
    <i>Happy Feet</i>released on October 31, 2006, although a small
    piece of the original song can be heard during a brief dance
    sequence. This recording appeared on the soundtrack album
    "Happy Feet: Music from the Motion Picture".</p>
      <p>It has also been covered by Donny Osmond on a DVD of a
    concert he performed in London, as well as by Widespread Panic
    on its 2004 live release 
    <i>Night of Joy</i>. The song was also covered by Melanie C in
    2003 at her Shepherd's Bush performance and included as a
    B-side on her single "Yeh Yeh Yeh".</p>
      <p>Fingerstyle jazz guitarist Tuck Andress recorded a solo
    guitar arrangement, as has guitarist Greg Howe.</p>
      <p>The Janet Jackson song Nasty features Janet singing the
    phrase "you nasty boy" in a direct mimic of the way Stevie
    delivers the same line in "I Wish".</p>
      <p>Pop group S Club 7 used part of the song as an instrumental
    outro to their hit Bring It All Back during their first
    tour.</p>
