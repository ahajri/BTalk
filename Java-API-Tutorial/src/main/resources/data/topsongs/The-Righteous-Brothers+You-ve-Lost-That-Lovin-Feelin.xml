      <p>"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'" is a 1965 number-one hit
    single in the United States and the United Kingdom by The
    Righteous Brothers. In 1999, the performing-rights organization
    Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) announced that it was the
    most-played song of the 20th century in the United States.
    Additionally, the song was chosen as one of the Songs of the
    Century by RIAA and ranked #34 on the list of the 500 Greatest
    Songs of All Time by Rolling Stone.</p>
      <p>Written by Barry Mann, Phil Spector and Cynthia Weil, the
    song is one of the foremost examples of producer Phil Spector's
    "Wall of Sound" technique. Recorded in Studio A of the famed
    Gold Star Studios in Los Angeles, it features lead vocals by
    Bill Medley. Bobby Hatfield reportedly expressed his annoyance
    to Spector upon learning that he would have to wait until the
    chorus before joining Medley’s vocals. When Hatfield asked
    Spector just what he was supposed to do during Medley’s solo,
    Spector replied: “You can go straight to the fucking bank.”
    Among the background singers in the song's crescendo is a young
    Cher.</p>
      <p>Cynthia Weil recalled that, "After Phil, Barry and I
    finished [writing it], we took it over to the Righteous
    Brothers. Bill Medley, who has the low voice, seemed to like
    the song." Even with his interest in the song, however, Medley
    had his doubts. In an interview with 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>magazine, he recalled, "We had no idea if
    it would be a hit. It was too slow, too long, and right in the
    middle of The Beatles and the British Invasion." Indeed, the
    song ran for nearly four minutes when released. This was much
    too long by contemporary AM standards, but Spector refused to
    cut it shorter. On the label where the time is indicated, he
    had "3:05" printed, instead of the track's actual running time
    of 3:45. He also added a false ending which made the recording
    more dramatic, and would also trick radio deejays into thinking
    it was a shorter song. Upon being played the finished record
    over the phone, co-writer Barry Mann reacted to Medley’s deep
    baritone by telling Spector, “Phil, you have it on the wrong
    speed!”</p>
      <p>"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin
    <span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>" topped the
    Billboard Hot 100 dated 6 February 1965 and remained at #1 the
    week of 13 February 1965. In additon the song crossed over to
    the R&amp;B charts peaking at number two .</p>
      <p>The Righteous Brothers' "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin
    <span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>" debuted at #35 on
    the UK Top 40 chart dated 16 January 1965: on the same chart a
    rival version by Cilla Black debuted at #28. Black had become a
    recording star by covering Dionne Warwick's newly released
    American hit "Anyone Who Had a Heart" for the UK market with a
    resultant #1 in February 1964; Black's producer Gordon Mills
    had repeated the strategy that had given Black her first #1 hit
    by having the songtress cover the Righteous Brothers new
    American release "You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling". (Black's
    version had an abbreviated bridge which she explained saying:
    "I don't want people to get bored";the abridgment also removed
    the necessity of Black's attempting to match the Righteous
    Brothers' climactic vocal trade-off.)The 24 January chart saw
    Black remain in ascendancy at #12 while the Righteous Brothers
    at #20 but while the 6 February chart saw Black jump to #2 the
    Righteous Brothers made a larger jump to #3 powered by a
    full-page ad Andrew Oldham had run in 
    <i>Melody Maker</i>:</p>
      <p>"This advert is not for commercial gain, it is taken as
    something that must be said about the great new PHIL SPECTOR
    Record, THE RIGHTEOUS BROTHERS singing "YOU'VE LOST THAT LOVIN'
    FEELING". Already in the American Top Ten, this is Spector's
    greatest production, the last word in Tomorrow's sound Today,
    exposing the overall mediocrity of the Music Industry. Signed,,
    Andrew Oldham"</p>
      <p>The UK Top 40 dated 20 February saw the Righteous Brothers'
    "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin
    <span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>" at #1 - it would
    remain there 27 February - while Black's version began its
    descent dropping to #5. Although Black's version of "You've
    Lost That Lovin' Feelin
    <span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>" would prove to be
    her highest charting UK single apart from her two #1's: "Anyone
    Who Had a Heart" and "You're My World", and also reached #2 in
    Australia - where the Righteous Brothers' version was also a
    hit at #5 - the eclipse of Black's version by the original did
    usher in a downtime in Black's recording career: after the
    followup "I've Been Wrong Before" fell short of the Top Ten at
    #17 in the spring of 1965 Black spent the remainder of the year
    concentrating on performing and resumed recording only at the
    start of 1966 when "Love's Just a Broken Heart" (#5) began the
    most successful year of her recording career.</p>
      <p>Cilla Black remade "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'" for her
    1985 
    <i>Surprisingly Cilla</i>album.</p>
      <p>The Righteous Brothers' "You've Lost that Lovin' Feelin
    <span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>" is the only single
    to enter the UK Top 10 three times, having successful
    re-releases in 1969 (#10) and 1990 (#3), the last release being
    to follow-up the re-release of "Unchained Melody", which had
    hit #1 due to being featured in the film 
    <i>Ghost</i>. "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin
    <span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>" also reached #42
    after a 1977 re-release and in 1988 reached #87.</p>
      <p>Hall &amp; Oates' US Top 20 remake of "You've Lost That
    Lovin' Feelin
    <span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>" in 1980 was a minor
    UK hit at #55. More successful was Telly Savalas' 1975 version
    which reached #47; Savalas' single was the follow-up to his
    novelty #1 "If" and was similarly talked rather than sung.</p>
      <p>"You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling" was the only single
    released off 
    <i>Soulful</i>a 1969 release aimed to showcase Dionne Warwick
    as more of an R&amp;B singer than was evinced by her work with
    Burt Bacharach. Co-produced by Warwick and Chips Moman and
    recorded at American Sound Studios in Memphis, Tennessee, 
    <i>Soulful</i>was one of Warwick's most successful albums with
    a #11 peak although "You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling" was not
    one of Warwick's very biggest hits (#16). In Australia the 
    <i>Go-Set</i>Top 40 chart ranked Warwick's version of "You've
    Lost That Lovin' Feeling" with a #34 peak in January of
    1970.[1] (Warwick's version spells the last word of the title
    out fully as "feeling" rather than the usual "feelin
    <span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>".)</p>
      <p>Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway's self-titled 1972 album
    featured a version of "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin
    <span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>" which was released
    as the second single after the Top 30 version of "You've Got a
    Friend". The Flack/Hathaway take on "You've Lost That Lovin'
    Feelin
    <span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>" reached #30 R&amp;B
    with a Billboard Hot 100 peak of #71 (Cash Box Top 100 Singles
    peak was #57;Record World 100 Pop Chart rank peak was #53).
    [2][3]</p>
      <p>In 1979 Long John Baldry featured "You've Lost That Lovin'
    Feelin
    <span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>" on 
    <i>Baldry's Out</i>the Jimmy Horowitz produced disc which was
    Baldry's first recording in his newly adopted homeland of
    Canada. This version is performed as a duet with Kathi McDonald
    who in singing the latter half of the first and second verse
    inverts the usual order. Released as a single, the mild
    Canadian chart success (#45) of Baldry's "You've Lost That
    Lovin' Feelin
    <span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>" spilled over into
    the US charts at #89. However the track did reach #2 in
    Australia in 1980 and Bill Medley of the Righteous Brothers has
    called the Baldry/McDonald version the best remake of "You've
    Lost That Lovin' Feelin
    <span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>". Baldry had first
    recorded the song for his 1966 album 
    <i>Looking at Long John</i>.</p>
      <p>The 1980 Hall &amp; Oates 
    <i>Voices</i>album featured a remake of "You've Lost That
    Lovin' Feelin
    <span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>" with a spare
    arrangement contrasting with the lavish Righteous Brothers
    version ; the second non-original song Hall &amp; Oates
    had ever recorded, the track was issued as the album's second
    single after the original "How Does It Feel to Be Back" peaked
    at a disappointing #30. The November peak of #12 made "You've
    Lost That Lovin' Feelin
    <span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>" the first Hall
    &amp; Oates single to ascend higher than #20 since the #1 hit
    "Rich Girl" in the spring of 1977. The Hall &amp; Oates
    comeback which began with "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin
    <span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>" was strengthened by
    the follow-up single "Kiss on My List" which inaugurated the
    duo's 80s superstardom attaining a #1 chart position and
    refocusing attention on Hall &amp; Oates' original
    material.</p>
      <p>In 1986 a remake of "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin
    <span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>" by Grant &amp;
    Forsyth reached #48 in the Netherlands, where the song was a
    #57 chart item in 2002 for André Hazes &amp; Johnny Logan.</p>
      <p>Günther Neefs reached #31 on the Belgian charts (Flemish
    region) with his 1996 recording "You've Lost That Loving
    Feeling".</p>
      <p>"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin
    <span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>" charted C&amp;W at
    #41 for Barbara Fairchild in 1975 while in 1988 Carroll Baker
    took the song to #8 on the C&amp;W chart in Canada.</p>
      <p>Barry Mann has twice recorded his composition "You've Lost
    That Lovin' Feelin
    <span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>", the first time on
    his 1971 album 
    <i>Lay It All Out</i>and on 
    <i>Soul and Inspiration</i>a 2000 Atlantic release comprising
    Mann's own renditions of his classic songs.</p>
      <p>Bill Medley recorded a version of "You've Lost That Lovin'
    Feelin
    <span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>" for his 1971 
    <i>A Song For You</i>album.</p>
      <p>Glen Campbell who was the rhythm guitarist on the Righteous
    Brothers' version of "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin
    <span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>" cut his own version
    of the song; it first appeared on the 1999 album 
    <i>My Hits and Love Songs</i>.</p>
      <p>The concert movie 
    <i>The Big T.N.T. Show</i>filmed at the Moulin Rouge in Los
    Angeles 29 November 1965 features Joan Baez singing "You've
    Lost That Lovin' Feelin
    <span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>" to the piano
    accompaniment of Phil Spector.</p>
      <p>Elvis Presley covered the song with a unique arrangement on
    his 1970 live album &amp; concert film 
    <i>That's the Way It Is</i>. Presley's version was reprised for
    his 1972 album 
    <i>Elvis: As Recorded at Madison Square Garden</i>.</p>

    <span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>" at the Princes
    Trust Rock Gala in 1987.</p>
      <p>Paul Shane's performance of "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin

    Moment on British Television in a poll on Channel 4 in 2004.
