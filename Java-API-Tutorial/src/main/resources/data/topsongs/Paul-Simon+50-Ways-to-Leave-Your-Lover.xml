      <p>"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover" is a 1975 hit song by Paul
    Simon, from his album 
    <i>Still Crazy After All These Years</i>. Backing vocals on the
    single were performed by Patti Austin, Valerie Simpson and
    Phoebe Snow.</p>
      <p>Written after Simon's divorce from first wife Peggy Harper,
    the song is a mistress's humorous advice to a husband on ways
    to end a relationship: 
    <i>Just slip out the back, Jack / Make a new plan, Stan</i>.
    Studio drummer Steve Gadd created the unique drum beat that
    became the hook and color for the song consisting of an almost
    military beat. The song was recorded in a small New York City
    studio on Broadway.</p>
      <p>"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover" broke in the U.S. in late
    December 1975 becoming number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100
    on February 7, 1976, and remaining there for three weeks. It
    was certified gold on March 11, 1976, and remained a best
    seller for nearly five months. The song also topped the adult
    contemporary chart for two weeks. It remains Simon's biggest
    solo hit.</p>
      <p>On the UK Singles Chart, the song reached position number 23
    in January 1976.</p>
      <p>The song has been covered several times, including the
    translations "30 manieres de quitter une fille" by the French
    singer Michel Delpech and "50 Tips ihn zu verlassen" by the
    German singer and actress Ulla Meinecke. On July 12, 2006, the
    Montreal International Jazz Festival played a 
    <i>Tribute to Paul Simon</i>and the song was covered by Jamie
    Cullum while the Platinum Pied Pipers made a Latin reworking of
    it. Hedy McDonald, Sandra Bernhard and the King's Singers also
    created their own versions as did British house music producer
    Trevor Jackson as Playgroup. The trance music group Plummet
    covered this song and released it in 2005.</p>
