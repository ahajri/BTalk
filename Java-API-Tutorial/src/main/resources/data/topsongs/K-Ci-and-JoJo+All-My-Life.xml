      <p>"All My Life" is a R&amp;B love ballad recorded by Jodeci
    members (and brothers) K-Ci and JoJo. It was released as a
    single from the duo's album 
    <i>Love Always</i>.</p>
      <p>It was K-Ci and JoJo's second number-one song, following
    2Pac's "How Do U Want It" (on which they were credited as
    featured vocalists). "All My Life" had earned enough airplay to
    debut on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 at number fifteen on March
    28, 1998, when the single was released to retail stores. It
    later jumped to number one and stayed there for three
    weeks.</p>
      <p>Shayne Ward recorded a cover version for his debut album, 
    <i>Shayne Ward</i>.</p>
      <p>Nelly samples the song in his single "Wadsyaname", as does
    Plies in his single "Medicine" featuring Keri Hilson.</p>
      <p>The opening violin of the song is sampled from "P.S. I Love
    You" by Frank Sinatra, while the piano part interpolates
    "Cliffs of Dover" by Eric Johnson.</p>
