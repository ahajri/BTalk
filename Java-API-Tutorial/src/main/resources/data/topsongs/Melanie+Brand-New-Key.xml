      <p>from the album 
    <i>Gather Me</i>
      </p>
      <p>"Brand New Key" is a pop song written by folk singer Melanie
    (Melanie Safka), which became a novelty hit in 1971-72. Taken
    from Melanie's album 
    <i>Gather Me</i>, it was also known as "The Rollerskate Song".
    It was her biggest hit, reaching #1 on the Billboard Hot 100
    singles chart in December 1971 and January 1972. It reached #1
    in Canada and Australia, and #4 in the UK charts. Melanie's
    version of "Brand New Key" was featured in the 1997 film 
    <i>Boogie Nights</i>.</p>
      <p>The song is lighthearted in tone, sung from the viewpoint of
    a girl trying to attract the attention of a boy:</p>
      <p>The rollerskates in question would have been quad skates
    which fit over ordinary footwear and were tightened with a
    screw. The girl's skates are presumably adequate, as she is
    already skating, but not perfect, as she needs the key:</p>
      <p>Many listeners detected innuendo in the lyrics, with the key
    in its lock symbolizing sexual intercourse, or in phrases like
    "I go pretty far" and "I been all around the world".</p>
      <p>Melanie has acknowledged the possibility of reading sexual
    innuendo in the song:</p>
      <p>"
    <i>Brand New Key</i>I wrote in about fifteen minutes one night.
    I thought it was cute; a kind of old thirties' tune. I guess a
    key and a lock have always been Freudian symbols, and pretty
    obvious ones at that. There was no deep serious expression
    behind the song, but people read things into it. They made up
    incredible stories as to what the lyrics said and what the song
    meant. In some places, it was even banned from the radio. My
    idea about songs is that once you write them, you have very
    little say in their life afterward. It's a lot like having a
    baby. You conceive a song, deliver it, and then give it as good
    a start as you can. After that, it's on its own. People will
    take it any way they want to take it."</p>
      <p>In 1976, the parody song "Combine Harvester (Brand New
    Key)", produced by Bob Barrett, was released in the UK by West
    Country comedy folk act The Wurzels and reached #1 for two
    weeks in June. New rustic-themed lyrics by Brendan
    O'Shaughnessy included "I got a brand new combine harvester An'
    I'll give you the key". The song was used prominently in the
    film 
    <i>Evil Aliens</i>.</p>
      <p>Following the January 1994 attack on Nancy Kerrigan, a
    parody of "Brand New Key" circulated on radio stations. The
    parody featured lyrics from Tonya Harding's point of view, and
    included the chorus,</p>
      <p>
         <i>I've got a brand new pair of figure skates,, You've got a
      busted knee;, They're gonna lock up my ex-husband and throw
      away the key</i>
      </p>
      <p>Minnie Driver parodied the song at the Spirit Award 2007.
    The song's lyrics were changed in order to mock the film, 
    <i>Pan's Labyrinth</i>.</p>
      <p>Pro-IRA music group the Irish Brigade recorded a song titled
    "Kinky Boots" that disparaged British forces in Northern
    Ireland. This song is sung to the tune of "Brand New Key", with
    lyrics such as "I drove my Saracen through your garden last
    night" replacing "I rollerskated to your door at daylight."</p>
