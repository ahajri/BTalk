      <p>"Sherry" is a song written by Bob Gaudio and originally
    recorded by The Four Seasons. It was their first
    nationally-released single and also their first number one hit,
    initially reaching the top of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 on
    September 15, 1962. It remained at number one for five
    consecutive weeks, and number one on the R&amp;B charts for one
    week.</p>
      <p>According to Gaudio, the song took about 15 minutes to write
    and was originally titled "Jackie Baby" (in honor of then-First
    Lady Jacqueline Kennedy).</p>
      <p>At the studio, the name was changed to "Terri Baby", and
    then eventually to "Sherry". the name of the daughter of
    Gaudio's best friend, New York disk jockey Jack Spector (one of
    the names that Gaudio pondered for the song was "Peri Baby,"
    which was the name of the record label for which Bob Crewe
    worked, named after the label owner's daughter).</p>
