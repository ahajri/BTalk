      <p>"If You Wanna Be Happy" is a song recorded by Jimmy Soul,
    written by Frank Guida. It hit number one on the Billboard Hot
    100 on May 18, 1963, as well as the R&amp;B singles chart. The
    song is based on the calypso "Ugly Woman" by Roaring Lion. It
    was issued on Guida's S.P.Q.R. label and distributed by London
    Records, and in the UK on EMI's Stateside label. The original
    single lists a running time of 2:14, some later releases are
    sightly longer due to a longer fade-out.</p>
      <p>The song is featured in the films 
    <i>Mermaids</i>(1990) and 
    <i>My Best Friend's Wedding</i>(1997).</p>
      <p>The band Rocky Sharpe and The Replays released a cover
    version of the song in 1983. The artists/bands Kid Creole and
    the Coconuts, Joe Dolce, The Skatalites and Barnes &amp; Barnes
    have released cover versions as well.</p>
      <p>The song was also sampled by Canadian Synth-Pop group Kon
    Kan in the track "Could Have Said I Told You So", taken from
    their second album entitled Syntonic.</p>
