      <p>"My Sweet Lord" is a song by former Beatles lead guitarist
    George Harrison from his UK number one hit triple album 
    <i>All Things Must Pass</i>. The song is primarily about Hindu
    God Krishna. It is ranked #454 on 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>magazine's list of "the 500 Greatest Songs
    of All Time."</p>
      <p>The song was originally intended for Billy Preston, who had
    a minor hit with it in early 1970, in his album 
    <i>Encouraging Words</i>. It was written in December 1969, when
    Harrison and Billy Preston were in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
      <p>The recording of the song took place in London. Preston was
    the principal musician while Harrison was engineering the
    sessions.</p>
      <p>When released as a single, "My Sweet Lord" topped the charts
    on both sides of the Atlantic. In October, 1970, Harrison told
    the British press that it was going to be his first solo
    single, but a few days later he changed his mind and said it
    would not be made available thus, as he did not want sales in
    that format to detract from those of the album. (The other
    three former Beatles had also released solo albums earlier that
    year, without releasing a single in Britain from any of them).
    It was released as a single in the US (Apple 2995) on 23
    November 1970. Within a few weeks, EMI and Apple Records bowed
    to media and public demand, and the UK release (Apple R 5884)
    followed on 15 January 1971.</p>
      <p>Entering the British charts in the first week at number
    seven and then hitting the summit for five weeks, it was the
    first single by an ex-Beatle to reach number one. It did so
    again in the UK when reissued in January 2002 after Harrison's
    death from cancer. It reached number one on the US Hot 100 on
    26 December 1970, remaining on top for four weeks.</p>
      <p>In Britain, the original single was officially a double-A
    Side with "What Is Life". In the US it was a double-A-side with
    "Isn't It A Pity"- with both sides featuring a full Apple
    label.</p>
      <p>Following the song's release, musical similarities between
    "My Sweet Lord" and The Chiffons' hit "He's So Fine" led to a
    lengthy legal battle over the rights to the composition.
    magazine, in an article dated 6 March 1971, stated that
    Harrison's royalty payments from the recording had been halted
    worldwide. Harrison stated that he was inspired to write "My
    Sweet Lord" after hearing the Edwin Hawkins Singers' "Oh Happy
    Day".</p>
      <p>In the U.S. federal court decision in the case, known as 
    <i>Bright Tunes Music v. Harrisongs Music</i>, Harrison was
    found to have "subconsciously" copied the earlier song. He was
    ordered to surrender the majority of royalties from "My Sweet
    Lord" and partial royalties from 
    <i>All Things Must Pass</i>. Former manager Allen Klein, who
    earlier had supported Harrison's case, became the owner of
    Bright Tunes, after they parted ways. In the long run this
    worked against Klein, but it resulted in the case continuing
    for years in court. Interestingly Harrison claimed in a BBC
    interview with Annie Nightingale that the Judge in the case
    said that he liked Harrison's version of "My Sweet Lord"
    more.</p>
      <p>The Chiffons would later record "My Sweet Lord" to
    capitalize on the publicity generated by the lawsuit. Country
    singer Jody Miller recorded a country chart top-five cover of
    "He's So Fine", which plays on the two songs' similarities by
    featuring the same guitar breaks played on the Harrison
    recording.</p>
      <p>Shortly thereafter, Harrison (who would eventually buy the
    rights to "He's So Fine") wrote and recorded a song about the
    court case named "This Song", which includes "This tune has
    nothing 'Bright' about it." "I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie,
    Honey Bunch)" and "Rescue Me" are also mentioned in the
    record.</p>
      <p>Early in the song, the background singers repeat the
    Christian and Jewish word of praise, "Hallelujah". Later, the
    background singers chant two Vaisnava Hindu prayers:</p>
      <p>This prayer consists of part of the principal mantra of
    devotees of the Gaudiya Vaisnavite faith, popularised in the
    Western world by the International Society for Krishna
    Consciousness (ISKCON), colloquially known as the 'Hare
    Krishnas'. Harrison was a devotee of this religious path.</p>
      <p>The mantra in full is "Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna,
    Krishna, Hare, Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama, Rama, Hare,
    Hare."</p>
      <p>This prayer is chanted by Hindu devotees prior to beginning
    any action, after hymns to Ganesha and Sarasvati. The prayer is
    dedicated to the spiritual teacher of the devotee which is
    equated with the Hindu Trinity Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva
    (Maheshvara) and with the Supreme Cosmic Spirit or Absolute
    Reality (Brahman). The prayer translates as:</p>
      <p>
         <i>The teacher is Brahmā, the teacher is Viṣṇu, the teacher
      is the Lord Maheśvara,</i>
         <i>Verily the teacher is the supreme Brahman, to that
      respected teacher I bow down.</i>
      </p>
      <p>The prayer is the first verse of the Guru stotram, a
    fourteen verse hymn dedicated to the spiritual teacher.</p>
      <p>Various Christian fundamentalist anti-rock activists have
    objected to the chanting of 'Hare Krishna' in the song as
    anti-Christian or satanic while some born-again Christians
    appear to have mistakenly adopted the song as an anthem.</p>
      <p>During his live performances of "My Sweet Lord", Harrison
    has tried to engage his audience into the practice of "chanting
    the holy names of the Lord" (kirtan):</p>
      <p>Breaking into the thundering rhythm guitar intro to “My
    Sweet Lord,” Harrison would soon begin to invite the cheering,
    largely stoned crowd to “chant the holy name of the Lord.” Few
    responded. Switching messiahs midstream, he would then rocket
    into the famous Krishna Hallelujah chorus and begin singing,
    “Om Christ, Om Christ, Om Christ” over and over, adding, “I
    know a lot of you out there think that’s swearing, but it’s
    not! If we all chant together purely for one minute, we’ll blow
    the roof off this place.</p>
      <p>Harrison himself performed the song in a self-parody for
    Eric Idle and Neil Innes' 
    <i>Rutland Weekend Television</i>Christmas special, broadcast
    26 December 1975 on BBC2. Harrison closed the show performing
    lip-sync'ed to a previously recorded track which started with
    the song, and changed to a pirate shanty once Harrison started
    'singing'. A clearly befuddled "Fatso" (Innes' band on the show
    backing Harrison) stop and eventually follow along and a group
    of dancers come out to join in the fun as the closing credits
    roll, while "host" Idle frequently walks onscreen, bewildered
    at Harrison's performance. This version is known as a "Pirate
    Song".</p>
      <p>With re-issued 
    <i>All Things Must Pass</i>for its thirtieth anniversary in
    2000, surfaced a new version of the song, added as a bonus
    track, with Harrison sharing vocals with Sam Brown.</p>
