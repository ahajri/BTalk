      <p>"Two Hearts" is a song performed by Phil Collins, written
    and produced by Collins and Lamont Dozier (of Motown's
    Holland-Dozier-Holland) for the 1988 crime comedy film 
    <i>Buster</i>. It won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original
    Song alongside the Carly Simon song "Let the River Run" from 
    <i>Working Girl</i>. Two music videos were made: one featuring
    Phil Collins as all four members in a band, and the other
    featuring Collins in a wrestling match against the Ultimate
    Warrior.</p>
      <p>The song topped the US Hot 100 for two weeks, the US adult
    contemporary chart for five weeks, and also reached #6 on the
    UK Singles Chart. It opened the radio station BBC Hereford and
    Worcester, appropriate in that the station was based in two
    different places.</p>
      <p>The B-side features Anne Dudley and the London Film
    Orchestra performing "The Robbery", also on the 
    <i>Buster</i>soundtrack.</p>
