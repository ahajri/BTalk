      <p>from the album 
    <i>With The Beatles</i>
      </p>
      <p>"Please Mr. Postman" is the debut single by The Marvelettes
    for the Tamla (Motown) label, notable as the first Motown song
    to reach the number-one position on the Billboard Hot 100 pop
    singles chart. The single achieved this position in late 1961;
    it hit number-one on the R&amp;B chart as well. "Please Mr.
    Postman" became a number-one hit again in early 1975, when The
    Carpenters' cover of the song also reached the top position of
    the Billboard Hot 100.</p>
      <p>In early 1961, The Marvelettes (then known as "The Marvels")
    arranged an audition for Berry Gordy's Tamla/Motown label.
    Marvels member Georgia Dobbins needed an original song for
    their audition, and got a blues song from her friend William
    Garrett, which she then reworked for the group. Dobbins left
    the group after the audition and was replaced, Gordy renamed
    the group and hired "Brianbert"—Brian Holland and Robert
    Bateman's songwriting partnership—to rework the song yet again.
    Freddie Gorman, another songwriting partner of Holland (before
    Holland became part of the Holland–Dozier–Holland team) was
    also was involved in the final reworking.</p>
      <p>The Marvelettes recording features lead singer Gladys Horton
    hoping that the postman has brought her a letter from her
    boyfriend, who is away at war. Instrumentation is provided by
    The Funk Brothers, including Marvin Gaye on drums.</p>
      <p>Songwriting credits for "Please Mr. Postman" seem to have
    changed over the years. The original Tamla 45 single for the
    Marvelettes' version credits "Dobbins/Garett/Brianbert" as the
    songwriters, and credits "Brianbert" as producer. The original 
    <i>With The Beatles</i>album cover credited it to just Brian
    Holland. The 1976 Beatles discography book 
    <i>All Together Now</i>credits it to Holland, Bateman, and
    Berry Gordy. The 1992 Motown boxed set 
    <i>Hitsville USA: The Motown Singles Collection</i>credits
    Dobbins, Garrett, Holland, Bateman, and Gorman as the
    composers. As of 2006, the Songwriters Hall of Fame credits
    "Please Mr. Postman" to just Holland, Bateman, and Gorman. [1].
    EMI Music Publishing, the current music publisher of the song
    list all five writers in their catalog. The Marvelettes'
    version appears in a bar fight scene in 
    <i>Mean Streets</i>, directed by Martin Scorsese.</p>
      <p>"Please Mr. Postman" has been covered frequently, including
    a version by The Beatles on their 
    <i>With The Beatles</i>album. Sung by John Lennon, their
    version reverses the genders. Later, a second hit version was
    recorded by The Carpenters, whose version took the song again
    to number-one on the Hot 100 in early 1975. The Pat Boone
    Family released their version of the song at approximately the
    same time, resulting in both versions appearing simultaneously
    on the South African Hit Parade. The Carpenters' cover version
    was also sampled by rapper Juelz Santana for his single "Oh
    Yes", as well as Lil' Wayne in his single off The Fix
    (unreleased) "Mr. Postman". It is used by the 
    <i>Rob, Arnie and Dawn Show</i>to introduce their Listener Mail
    segment, and was sung by the presenters of British Saturday
    morning show SMTV Live to introduce the mailbag section. The
    song in disco version has also been covered by the Shampoo
    (Belgium) in 1980.</p>
      <p>The Beatles included "Please Mister Postman" as part of
    their live act in 1962, performing it regularly at the Cavern
    Club. By the time it was recorded for their second album, 
    <i>With The Beatles</i>, it had been dropped from their set,
    and required some work in the studio to bring it up to an
    acceptable standard. Ian MacDonald criticised their version for
    having a "wall of sound" and for a "general airlessness."</p>
      <p>The Carpenters' version resembles an old 50s rock &amp; roll
    song. The single was released in late 1974, reached number one
    on both the Billboard Hot 100 and "Easy Listening" charts in
    January of 1975, and was a million-selling Gold record. The
    corresponding 
    <i>Horizon</i>album was belatedly released in June 1975. A
    music video of the song, filmed in Disneyland, can be found on
    the DVD 
    <i>Gold: Greatest Hits</i>(released in 2002), originally
    packaged as 
    <i>Yesterday Once More</i>(released on VHS in 1985).</p>
