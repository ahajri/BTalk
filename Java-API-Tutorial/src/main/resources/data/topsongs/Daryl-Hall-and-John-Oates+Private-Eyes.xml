      <p>"Private Eyes" is the hit 1981 single by Hall &amp; Oates
    and the title track from their album of that year. The song was
    #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts for 2 weeks, from November 7
    through November 20, 1981. This single was the band's third of
    six #1 hits (the first two being "Rich Girl" and "Kiss on My
    List") and their second #1 hit of the 1980s. Interestingly, it
    was succeeded by Olivia Newton-John's "Physical," which was in
    turn succeeded by another #1 hit from Hall and Oates, "I Can't
    Go for That (No Can Do)."</p>
      <p>In an interview with American Songwriter, Daryl Hall states:
    "That’s a real Janna Allen [co-writer and sister of Sara Allen]
    song. Janna, and I, and Warren Pash wrote that. Warren and
    Janna wrote most of the song, and I took it and changed it
    around-changed the chords. Sandy [Sara Allen] and I wrote the
    lyrics. It’s a real family song, the Allen sisters and me."</p>
      <p>The music video featured the band dressed as detectives and
    was the first to feature the backup band of guitarist G. E.
    Smith, bassist Tom "T-Bone" Wolk, drummer Mickey Curry, and
    saxophone/keyboardist Charles DeChant. The song was co-written
    with Canadian songwriter Warren Pash.</p>
      <p>The single carries a similar rhythm to the duo's number one
    hit from earlier that year, "Kiss On My List," with the
    difference being a handclap chorus that has made the song an
    audience-participation favorite at live Hall and Oates shows.
    It was one of the duo's first songs to appear in heavy rotation
    on MTV.</p>
      <p>The song is performed by private investigator Vinnie Van
    Lowe in the Veronica Mars episode "Kanes and Abel's." After
    Veronica tries to bug Vinnie's office, he asks his receptionist
    (also his mother) who his favorite band is, then leans out the
    window and sings the song to an eavesdropping Veronica. At one
    point he changes the chorus from "Private Eyes" to "Veronica
    Mars/I'm watching you."</p>
      <p>The Disney Channel ran a DTV music video of the song, set
    mostly to clips from the Goofy cartoon short 
    <i>How to Be a Detective</i>.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Captain Kangaroo</i>in the early '80's had a puppet vignette
    of the song.</p>
