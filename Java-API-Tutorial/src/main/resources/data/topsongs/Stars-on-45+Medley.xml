      <p>"Stars on 45 Medley" was a song issued in 1981 by the studio
    group Stars on 45. It was originally released as "Stars on 45"
    by Stars on 45, in the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand
    the band was credited to 'Starsound' and the medley itself was
    named "Stars on 45". Its official title in the US (as on the
    record and in 
    <i>Billboard</i>) where it was credited to 'Stars On 45' (see
    image to right) was "Medley: Intro / / / / / / / / / / / Stars
    on 45". It reached #1 in the Netherlands in February 1981, a
    few months later #2 in the UK and #1 on the Billboard Hot 100
    on June 20, 1981. It is (to date) the longest titled song to
    ever chart in 
    <i>Billboard</i>, and is usually known by the shorter nickname,
    "Stars on 45 Medley". The reason for the long title was
    copyright requirements for the use of The Beatles' songs. On
    the US single, the initial "Stars on 45" intro is omitted on
    the 45 recording even though "Intro" appears on the title.</p>
      <p>The origin of the single is the Netherlands where numerous
    bootleg disco singles were floating around and Willem van
    Kooten, the owner of one of the copyrights, decided to make a
    similar, legitimate record. He found singers who sounded
    similar to John Lennon and Paul McCartney and decided to make
    the single focus on The Beatles. The original version was a
    nine minute forty-five second 12" mix, then a 45 version was
    also released and the Beatles medley was later extended to a
    full sixteen-minute album side and appeared on the Stars on
    45's first full-length release, 
    <i>Long Play Album</i>(US title: 
    <i>Stars on Long Play</i>, UK title: 
    <i>Stars on 45 - The Album</i>).</p>
      <p>The song was also a huge success in the UK where it kicked
    off a craze for medleys, with a large number of records in the 
    <i>Stars on 45</i>mold reaching the UK Top 40 in 1981.</p>
      <p>The album version of the song moved "Venus" and "Sugar
    Sugar" to Side Two into a different medley, and added several
    more Beatles songs as well as a 32 second instrumental extract
    from George Harrison's "My Sweet Lord" and even a fleeting
    reference to new wave band The Sparks for a total length of
    about fifteen minutes. The album version was also released as
    "Long Play Album"; a detailed listing of the source material
    can be found 
    <i>there</i>.</p>
      <p>The success of the single in North America even resulted in
    Radio Records rush-releasing a second single for the US market.
    The last four minutes of the album version of the Beatles
    medley ("Good Day Sunshine"/"My Sweet Lord"/"Here Comes The
    Sun"/"While My Guitar Gently Weeps"/"Taxman"/"A Hard Day's
    Night"/"Things We Said Today"/"If I Fell"/"You Can't Do
    That"/"Please Please Me"/"I Want To Hold Your Hand"/"Stars On
    45") was released under the title "Stars On 45 Medley 2" but
    peaked at #67 on Billboard's Hot 100. The second Beatles medley
    single was not released in either the Netherlands, the UK or
    any other parts of the world.</p>
      <p>The Beatles medley was remixed and re-released in a house
    music version in Europe in 1989 under the title "Stars on '89
    Remix", then featuring an alternate selection of Beatles tracks
    taken from the album version of the medley, coupled with a new
    "Stars on 45" theme called "Rock the House". The single was
    remixed and reproduced by Danny van Passel and Rutti Kroese and
    released on the Red Bullet label as a 7", 12" and CD single,
    all formats backed with an extended version of the "Rock the
    House" theme.</p>
