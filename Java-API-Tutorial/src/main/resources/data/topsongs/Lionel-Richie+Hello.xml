      <p>"Hello" is a song by Lionel Richie. Taken as the third
    single from Richie's multi-platinum album 
    <i>Can't Slow Down</i>, the song was released in 1984 and
    reached number one on three 
    <i>Billboard</i>music charts: the pop chart (for two weeks),
    the R&amp;B chart (for three weeks), and the adult contemporary
    chart (for six weeks). The song also went to #1 on the UK
    Singles Chart. It is considered by many as Richie's signature
    song.</p>
      <p>The song is particularly memorable for the line "Hello, is
    it me you're looking for?". In an interview broadcast in the UK
    on Channel 4's 
    <i>Top 100 Number One Hits</i>, Richie said he had been thanked
    by a large number of normally tongue-tied men who had proposed
    marriage after a slow dance to the song.</p>
      <p>Arguably the music video attracted more attention than the
    song, for its story of Richie's character (a music teacher)
    having a seemingly unrequited love for a blind arts student
    (played by Laura Carrington, an actress who is not blind) until
    he discovers she shares the feeling as demonstrated by the
    discovery that she is sculpting a likeness of his head (which
    was actually created by a professional sculptor who never met
    Lionel). The video has been parodied a number of times
    including a Starburst commercial when the sculpture is made
    from Starburst candy. According to the video's appearance in
    VH1's Pop Up Video, the video was an adaptation of an
    unproduced screenplay called "Spaldeen Summers".</p>
      <p>"Hello" was featured in the 2005 film 
    <i>The 40-Year-Old Virgin</i>, as well as Roman Polański's 1992
    film 
    <i>Bitter Moon</i>. It was also parodied in the movie 
    <i>Scary Movie 4</i>during the 
    <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>parody. The intro was used during a
    stormy scene in 
    <i>Are We Done Yet?</i>, only to be cut short by a lightning
    bolt.</p>
      <p>The line "Hello, is it me you're looking for?" is sung by a
    male penguin in the film 
    <i>Happy Feet</i>(2006). The line is also included with
    Richie's face on a t-shirt sold at kiosks in shopping
    malls.</p>
      <p>Also, the Disney TV special 
    <i>DTV Valentine</i>featured a music video of the song set to
    the "Twitterpated" scene from 
    <i>Bambi</i>. Peter Griffin also listened to "Hello" in the 
    <i>Family Guy</i>episode "Stewie Kills Lois" repeatedly saying
    "Oh God, Lionel, you have been hurt. You have been hurt by
    somebody, that much is clear. Who hurt you? Who hurt you? Who
    hurt you, who hurt you". An excerpt was sung by Kristen
    Chenoweth in season 2, episode 11 of "Pushing Daisies." It was
    also used in several episodes of 
    <i>Seinfeld</i>. This usually occurred when one of the
    characters went to the beach to make a big decision.</p>
