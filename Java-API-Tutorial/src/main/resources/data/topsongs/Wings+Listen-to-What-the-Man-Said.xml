      <p>"Listen to What the Man Said" is a hit single from Wings'
    1975 album 
    <i>Venus and Mars</i>. The song featured new member Joe English
    on drums, with guest musicians Dave Mason on guitar and Tom
    Scott on soprano saxophone.</p>
      <p>"Listen to What the Man Said" was recorded in early 1975 by
    Wings during their New Orleans sessions for 
    <i>Venus and Mars</i>. The 
    <i>Venus and Mars</i>sessions directly succeeded their
    Nashville sessions, where Wings recorded their hit single
    "Junior's Farm" and its relatively successful B-side, "Sally
    G".</p>
      <p>The song was also included on the greatest hits compilations
    
    <i>All the Best!</i>and 
    <i>Wingspan: Hits and History</i>. Even though it reached #1 in
    the US (#8 easy listening) and #6 in the UK, it was not
    included on the first Wings compilation, 
    <i>Wings Greatest</i>.</p>
      <p>Band member Denny Laine covered "Listen to What the Man
    Said" in 2007 on his album 
    <i>Chronicles of Wings</i>. The same year, Freedy Johnston
    covered this song as well in his album 
    <i>My Favourite Waste of Time</i>.</p>
