      <p>"The Candy Man" 
    <span class="unicode" style="white-space:nowrap;">
  (Â·)
</span>(or alternately, "The Candy Man Can") is a song from the
1971 film 
    <i>Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory</i>. It was written
    by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley specifically for the film
    and does not appear in the original book or the 2005 film
    adaptation of Roald Dahl's 
    <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i>. It was sung by Aubrey
    Woods, who played Bill the candy store owner in the original
    film.</p>
      <p>"The Candy Man" was most famously covered by Sammy Davis,
    Jr.. His version of "The Candy Man" hit number one on the
    Billboard Hot 100 chart on June 10, 1972, spending three weeks
    there. It also spent two weeks atop the adult contemporary
    chart. The track featured vocals by the Mike Curb Congregation,
    who had earlier released their own unsuccessful version of the
    song. Davis was interested in playing the character of Bill in
    the original film. Although producers balked at the idea (and
    although he originally disliked the song), Davis eventually
    worked the song into his shows and it is now recognized as one
    of his signature songs.</p>
      <p>"The Candy Man" has been featured in a number of radio,
    films and TV shows.</p>
