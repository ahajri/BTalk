      <p>"Kiss on My List" is a 1980 song recorded by Daryl Hall and
    John Oates. It was the third single from their album 
    <i>Voices</i>, and became their second Billboard Hot 100
    number-one single in 1981 (after "Rich Girl" in 1977).</p>
      <p>It was written by Janna Allen and Daryl Hall, and produced
    by Hall and Oates.</p>
      <p>While two other songs from the album had returned the duo to
    chart activity, it was the success of "Kiss on My List" that
    confirmed the start of the duo's sustained run as one of
    American pop's top-selling acts, a run that lasted into
    1989.</p>
      <p>According to Daryl Hall, Eddie Van Halen copied the synth
    part of this song and used it for the song "Jump" by Van
    Halen.</p>
