   <descr>
      <p>"(Love Is) Thicker Than Water" is a 1977 song by Andy
    Gibb.</p>
      <p>A demonstration of the Gibb brothers' U.S. chart domination
    in 1978, this song replaced the song by Andy's brothers, the
    Bee Gees, with their #1 single "Stayin' Alive", when it reached
    #1 on the Hot 100 on March 4. This song was replaced at number
    one by the Bee Gees' own "Night Fever". This was then replaced
    by Yvonne Elliman's "If I Can't Have You". Since Barry Gibb had
    a hand in writing all four of these songs, he became the only
    person in history to write four consecutive US Number One
    singles; this feat has not been matched to this day.</p>
