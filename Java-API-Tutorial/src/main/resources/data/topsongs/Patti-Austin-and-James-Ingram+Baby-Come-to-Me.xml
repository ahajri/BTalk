      <p>"Baby, Come to Me" is an R&amp;B song, written by Rod
    Temperton for a male-female duet. The original version,
    performed by Patti Austin and James Ingram (with Michael
    McDonald contributing background vocals), and produced by
    Quincy Jones, appeared on Austin's 1981 album, 
    <i>Every Home Should Have One.</i>As a single it had minor
    chart success in early 1982, peaking at #73 on the Hot 100
    chart. Later that year, however, it gained new exposure as the
    romantic theme song for Luke Spencer, a leading character on
    the ABC soap opera 
    <i>General Hospital</i>. ABC received so many inquiries about
    the song that Warner Brothers decided to re-release it as a
    single, and it shot to number one in early 1983. The song also
    spent three weeks at #1 on the adult contemporary chart.</p>
      <p>Among those artists who have covered the song since are
    Alexander O'Neal and Cherrelle, the Captain and Tennille, Daryl
    Hall, Laura Fygi, and Stephanie Winslow.</p>
