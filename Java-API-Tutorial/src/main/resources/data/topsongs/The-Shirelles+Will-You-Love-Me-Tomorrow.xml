      <p>"Will You Love Me Tomorrow" is the title of a song written
    by Gerry Goffin and Carole King. It has been recorded by many
    different artists and was ranked among Rolling Stone's list of
    The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time at #125. The song is notable
    for being the first song to reach US #1 by an all-girl
    group.</p>
      <p>In 1960, The Shirelles released their version as Scepter
    single 1211, with Soldier Boy on the B-side. When first
    presented with the song, lead singer Shirley Owens (later known
    as Shirley Allston-Reeves) did not want to record it, because
    she thought it was "too country." She relented after a string
    arrangement was added. In 1961, the song went to number one on
    the Billboard Hot 100. However, Owens recalled on Jim Parsons'
    syndicated oldies radio program, 
    <i>Shake Rattle Showtime</i>, that some radio stations had
    banned the record because they had felt the lyrics were too
    sexually charged.</p>
      <p>This version of the song is currently ranked as the 101st
    greatest song of all time, as well as the best song of 1960, by
    Acclaimed Music.</p>
      <p>This song has since been remade by many artists. Notable
    versions include those by these artists:</p>
