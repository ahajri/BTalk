      <p>"Love Will Keep Us Together" is a popular song written by
    Neil Sedaka and Howard Greenfield in 1973. It was first
    released in the United Kingdom on Sedaka's 1973 LP 
    <i>The Tra-La Days Are Over</i>, which was never released in
    the U.S. The song arrived in the U.S. the following year when
    it appeared on Sedaka's compilation album 
    <i>Sedaka's Back</i>.</p>
      <p>Although Sedaka (and Wilson Pickett) recorded the song
    earlier in the 1970s, it is best remembered for the subsequent
    1975 cover version by The Captain &amp; Tennille. It was their
    debut single, reaching #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the week
    ending June 21, 1975 and remaining in the top position for four
    weeks, and was the top US single for the entire year. Their
    recording also received a Grammy Award for Record of the Year.
    "The Captain," aka Daryl Dragon, and Toni Tennille acknowledged
    Sedaka's authorship as well as his mid-1970s comeback by
    working the phrase "Sedaka is back" into the song's fadeout.
    The Spanish version of the song, "Por Amor Viviremos", was
    released as well during the summer of 1975 and charted as high
    as number 49 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song was
    released as the only single from the LP "Por Amor Viviremos"
    which was the same LP as "Love Will Keep Us Together", only
    rerecorded entirely in Spanish.</p>
      <p>In 1976, The Tubes covered "Love Will Keep Us Together" with
    a live show track on the album "T.R.A.S.H.". In the 1978 Mae
    West movie Sextette, West and Timothy Dalton cover the tune in
    a Disco style. In 1983, The Circle Jerks covered "Love Will
    Keep Us Together" as one of the six cover versions on "Golden
    Shower of Hits (Jerks on 45)", which appears on their third
    album with the same title. The song was also covered by
    Nickelback in 2001 for the Andrew Denton Breakfast Show Musical
    Challenge on Sydney, Australia's version of radio station
    Triple M, and was later added as a bonus track on some versions
    of their 2003 album The Long Road.</p>
      <p>In 1999, French singer Sheila, who is best known
    internationally as Sheila B.Devotion ('Spacer' 1979), covered
    the song for her album 'Dense'. The song was released as a cd
    single and 12 inch with remixes in the Summer of 2000 (EMI
    France).</p>
      <p>The song was featured on the video game Karaoke Revolution
    Presents: American Idol.</p>
      <p>The song was also featured as the opening of film 
    <i>Get Over It</i>starring Kirsten Dunst. It appears in Starsky
    and Hutch (2004) , Sextette (1978) and House Arrest (1996).</p>
