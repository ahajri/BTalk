      <p>"Undercover Angel" was a hit single for singer/songwriter
    Alan O'Day. Certified gold, it reached #1 on the Billboard Hot
    100 (with #4 for the year of 1977) and #9 on the Australian
    Singles Chart.</p>
      <p>Alan O'Day, a Hollywood-native, had scored some B-movies in
    the 1960s, and in 1971 became a songwriter for Warner Brothers
    Music. He had written hit songs for other artists such as Helen
    Reddy, Bobby Sherman, Cher, and the Righteous Brothers. In
    1977, Warner Brothers Music decided to form a special label for
    their composers who also performed. O'Day was the first artist
    signed, and the first release was "Undercover Angel."</p>
      <p>The song, which O'Day described as a "nocturnal novelette,"
    was released without fanfare in February 1977. But within a few
    months it had become #1 in the country, even without an album
    to support it. O'Day said about the experience, "It's wonderful
    when you find out what feels right, and then it also feels
    right to other people. That's a songwriter's dream."[1]</p>
      <p>The song begins with a man commiserating his loneliness,
    when a woman suddenly appears in his bed, and encourages him to
    make love to her. The rest of the song describes his feelings
    about her, then he discovers she must leave him, and he is
    saddened. She tells him to "go find the right one, love her and
    then, when you look into her eyes you'll see me again."</p>
      <p>He then explains that was his story, as apparently he has
    been singing this song to a woman whom he is trying to seduce,
    and how he wants to look in her eyes to see if she is the
    reincarnation of the angel he found.</p>
