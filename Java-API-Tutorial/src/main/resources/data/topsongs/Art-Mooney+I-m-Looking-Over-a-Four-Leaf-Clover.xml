      <p>"I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover" is a song from 1927,
    written by Mort Dixon with music by Harry M. Woods. It was a
    hit for Art Mooney in 1948 and was largely popularized by him.
    In modern times the song is perhaps most associated with 
    <i>Merrie Melodies</i>cartoons, as it appeared in several of
    them. The Sons of Ben, the official supporters' group of Major
    League Soccer's Philadelphia Union, have adopted the song as
    one of their chants.</p>
