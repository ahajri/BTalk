      <p>"Mickey" is a 1982 successful U.S. popular music song
    recorded by singer and choreographer Toni Basil. Written by
    Mike Chapman and Nicky Chinn as "Kitty," it was first recorded
    by UK popular music group Racey during 1979.</p>
      <p>Basil's infatuation with actor and singer Monkee Micky
    Dolenz during her work as a choreographer/dancer on the set of
    the Monkees 1968 movie 
    <i>Head</i>prompted her to change the lyrics to "Mickey" to
    better correspond to her real-life experience, and to change
    the gender from female to male. The single scored number one on
    the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 for 1 week and number two in the UK
    singles chart. The song was Basil's only top 40 success, making
    her a "one hit wonder".</p>
