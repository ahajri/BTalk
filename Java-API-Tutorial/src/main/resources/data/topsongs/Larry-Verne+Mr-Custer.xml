      <p>"Mr. Custer" is a novelty song, sung by Larry Verne, and
    written by Al DeLory, Fred Darian and Joseph Van Winkle that
    was a number-one song in the United States during the year
    1960. It topped the Hot 100 singles chart for the issue dated
    October 10, 1960, and remained there for one week. It is a
    comical song about a soldier's plea to Custer at the climatic
    Battle of the Little Bighorn against the Sioux that he did not
    want to fight.</p>
