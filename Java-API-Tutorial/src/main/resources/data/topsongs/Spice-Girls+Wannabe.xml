      <p>"Wannabe" is a song by the British pop group Spice Girls,
    released as their debut single, and widely considered to be
    their signature song. It was written by the Spice Girls,
    Richard Stannard and Matt Rowe for the group's debut album 
    <i>Spice</i>(see 1996 in music).</p>
      <p>"Wannabe" is an uptempo pop song with a touch of white
    hip-hop, rap and dance music; the lyrics are a demand of
    sincerity, with a feminist message of choosing friends over
    relationships, the song became an iconic symbolism of female
    empowerment and the most emblematic song of the Girl Power
    philosophy. Despite receiving mixed reviews from music critics,
    the song won Best British-Written Single at the 1997 Ivor
    Novello Awards and Best Single at the 1997 BRIT Awards.</p>
      <p>The single was released in July 1996 in the United Kingdom,
    reaching the top of the UK Singles Chart for seven consecutive
    weeks, and received a platinum certification by the British
    Phonographic Industry (BPI). In January 1997 the song was
    released in the United States topping the Hot 100 for four
    weeks, becoming their only number-one single in that
    country.</p>
      <p>By the end of 1996 it had topped the charts in 22 nations,
    and by March 1997 this number had climbed to 31, before it
    became the best-selling single by a female group in the history
    of recorded sound, selling over six million copies
    worldwide.</p>
      <p>"Wannabe" was co-written by the Spice Girls, Richard
    Stannard and Matt Rowe. Stannard and Rowe also co-produced the
    track. The song's central emphasis is the union and solidarity
    of friends, an implicit challenge to any "wannabe" lovers.</p>
      <p>Stannard and Rowe began writing with the group in January
    1995, and the first song they wrote was called "Feed Your
    Love", a slow, soulful song which was eventually recorded and
    mastered for the 
    <i>Spice</i>album – but not used because it was considered "too
    rude" for their target audience. Having completed that one, the
    girls wanted to write something a bit more uptempo.</p>
      <p>Rowe set up a drum loop on his MPC 3000 drum machine, which
    was quite fast but also had a strutting quality about it. For
    Stannard the rhythm brought to mind the spirit of John Travolta
    and Olivia Newton-John performing "You're the One That I Want"
    in 
    <i>Grease</i>. Then the girls added their own contributions
    into the mix.</p>
      <p>Rowe commented: "They made all these different bits up, not
    thinking in terms of verse, chorus, bridge or what was going to
    go where, just coming up all these sections of chanting,
    rapping and singing. And then we just sewed it together."</p>
      <p>Halliwell wrote in the group's first official book 
    <i>Girl Power!</i>that Melanie Brown and Emma Bunton came up
    with the song's chorus, and was in that moment that they
    realised they had something good.</p>
      <p>The group and the producers were working all week on the
    song, but only half was completed by Friday night, so it was
    decided to finish it the following week. According to Victoria
    Beckham's autobiography 
    <i>Learning to Fly</i>, that week she traveled to Torquay to
    attend the wedding of a friend of her then boyfriend Mark Wood;
    she communicated with the other girls with a cellphone she and
    Halliwell recently bought; even though Beckham wrote: "It's not
    the same thing by phone". The song was finished and by the time
    they were going to record it, every solo part was already
    divided between the four girls. Beckham only participates
    during the chorus of the song.</p>
      <p>While other tracks on the album each required two or three
    weeks of studio time, the group was able to record "Wannabe" in
    under an hour – mainly because they had already written parts
    of the song beforehand.</p>
      <p>The song won International Hit Of The Year and Best
    British-Written Single at the 1997 Ivor Novello Awards
    presented by the British Academy of Composers and Songwriters.
    It also won Best Single at the 1997 BRIT Awards.</p>
      <p>"Wannabe" received mixed reviews from music critics.
    Allmusic's reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine said "none of the
    Girls have great voices, but they do exude personality and
    charisma, which is what drives bouncy dance-pop like 'Wannabe',
    with its ridiculous 'zig-a-zig-ahhh' hook, into pure pop guilty
    pleasure".</p>
      <p>Christina Kelly from 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>called the Spice Girls "another bubblegum
    pop group that offer a watered-down mix of hip-hop and cheesy
    pop balladry, brought together by a manager with a marketing
    concept", adding "Spice Girls' idea of power seems to be
    flaunting that they are all that, but the lyrics make Alanis
    Morissette's sound like Patti Smith's. A few nuggets: 'If you
    want to get with me, better make it fast...' Despite their
    pro-woman posing, the Girls don't get bogged down by anything
    deeper than mugging for promo shots and giving out tips on
    getting boys in bed." In a poll conducted by the magazine to
    identify the ten most annoying songs, this song was ranked
    eighth.</p>
      <p>Matt Diehl from 
    <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>also noticed the combination of
    genres describing "Wannabe" as "more a compendium of music
    styles (from ABBA-style choruses to unconvincing hip hop) than
    an actual song", but added that "there's something endearing
    about this goofily formulaic Euro pop".</p>
      <p>Sputnikmusic in a review for 
    <i>Spice</i>called the lyrics "dire" and wondered "how could
    parents feed this to their 10-year-olds? The album's lyrics are
    so heavily laden with smut, I'm surprised they even let their
    kids have the album" and then used "Wannabe" as an example
    saying "The gist of the song is basically get your act together
    and treat me right, or there's no show. Not to mention the
    famous zig-a-zig-ha... try replacing it with the word 'sex' in
    the lyrics and see how it all suddenly makes perfect sense",
    adding "this track is built around an infectious keyboard riff,
    and so profoundly annoying, you'll want to rip your toenails
    off just so it will stop. But it's also really catchy, which
    makes you hate it even more." Another review from
    "Sputnikmusic" said "The lively bubble-gum pop of the Spice
    Girls embodied a gender not willing to lie down, and their
    debut single "Wannabe" acted as a proverbial kick in the pants
    for male chauvinists worldwide."</p>
      <p>In 
    <i>The Simpsons</i>episode "Maximum Homerdrive", Homer plays
    the song in the truck and refers to it as the ultimate
    truck-driver song. Homer sings the song in the episode
    "Fraudcast News" when the power was cut off by Mr. Burns and he
    uses the batteries "that have to power everything" in their
    house to play this song on the radio. "Ralph Wiggum also sang
    the opening lines of the song in the season 20 episode How The
    Test Was Done. The song was also used in 
    <i>The O.C.</i>episode "The Case of the Franks", in the episode
    "Stand Up And Holler" of the CBS crime drama 
    <i>Cold Case</i>, and in the finale of the fourth season of 
    <i>One Tree Hill</i>. In 2007, online voters rated "Wannabe"
    #33 on VH1's list of "The 100 Greatest Songs of the '90s".</p>
      <p>The music video for "Wannabe" was shot in April 1996,
    directed by Jhoan Camitz and produced by Mod Films. The clip
    appears to be one continuous take (although there were two
    barely noticeable edits) of the girls creating mischief at the
    Midland Grand Hotel in St. Pancras. Among their antics is
    Melanie Chisholm's back handspring on one of the tables. In
    their first book 
    <i>Girl Power!</i>, Geri Halliwell wrote about the video: "I
    remember the chaos and the cold. It wasn't very controlled - we
    didn't want it to be. We wanted the camera to capture the
    madness of "Spice".</p>
      <p>When the music video was released and first appeared on UK
    cable network The Box, it was selected so frequently that it
    reached the top of the viewers' chart within 2 hours of going
    on air, staying at number-one for 13 weeks, being aired up to
    70 times a week at its peak and becoming the most requested
    track in the channel's history.</p>
      <p>A promotional video for the song which includes clips from
    the making of the video was issued by Virgin Records before the
    official video was released. In the promo the group is seen
    singing "Wannabe" at the recording studio; they described the
    origin of "Spice" and their first impressions of each other,
    and they also sang the chorus of "One of These Girls", which
    would eventually was released as the B-side for their third
    single, "2 Become 1". The video won Best Dance Video at the
    1997 MTV Video Music Awards. It was also ranked at number
    forty-one in the Top 100 Pop Videos of all time by Channel
    4.</p>
      <p>"Wannabe" was released in the United Kingdom on 8 July 1996,
    debuting on the UK Singles Chart at number three, before
    climbing to number one the next week, knocking Gary Barlow's
    "Forever Love". It then spent seven weeks at the top, the
    second longest stay by an all female group, only behind
    Shakespear's Sister's "Stay", which spent eight weeks at number
    one in 1992. With eighteen weeks in the Top 40, and twenty-six
    weeks in the Top 75, it sold over 1,269,841 million copies,
    becoming the second biggest-selling single of the year, the
    twelfth best-selling single of the decade, the fortieth
    best-selling single ever in the UK, and is still the biggest
    selling single by a female group in the UK.</p>
      <p>In Europe the single reached the number-one position in
    almost every country it charted. On 14 September 1996 the song
    reached the top of the Eurochart Hot 100 for nine consecutive
    weeks, before it was replaced by the group's second single,
    "Say You'll Be There". In Ireland the song reached the
    number-one position the first week of August, staying at the
    top for four consecutive weeks.</p>
      <p>In France the song debuted on 27 July 1996 at number
    forty-seven, reached the top position ten weeks later for three
    consecutive weeks, remained twenty-four weeks on the chart, and
    received a diamond certification by the Syndicat National de
    l'Edition Phonographique in June 1997. In Germany the song
    debuted on 12 August 1996 at the sixty-one position, reaching
    the top of the chart five weeks later for four consecutive
    weeks, remaining twenty-two weeks in the chart, and received a

    third position in Italy.</p>
      <p>"Wannabe" debuted at number forty-five in Australia,
    reaching the top of the ARIA Singles Chart for eleven weeks,
    and ending at number-five at the 1996 year-end chart. In New
    Zealand the single debuted on 1 September 1996 at number
    thirty-eight, reaching the first position ten weeks later,
    staying there for only one week, and thirty-two weeks in
    total.</p>
      <p>In Canada, "Wannabe" debuted at the eighty-nine position of
    the singles chart, reaching its peak at number nine in its
    eighth week, remaining on the chart for sixteen weeks, and
    ending at the sixty-eight position on the year-end chart. The
    song was more successful on the Dance Chart, where it reached
    the top for three weeks, and ended at the top of the year-end
    chart.</p>
      <p>In the United States, the song debuted on 25 January 1997 at
    number eleven. At the time was the highest-ever debut by a
    British act in the U.S. beating the record previously held by
    The Beatles for "I Want to Hold Your Hand" at number twelve. It
    reached the top of the chart in its fifth week, knocking Toni
    Braxton's "Un-Break My Heart", staying there for four
    consecutive weeks simultaneously with the group's fourth single
    ("Mama"/"Who Do You Think You Are") being at number one in the
    UK. It was a successful number-one single, reaching the sixth
    position of the Hot 100 Airplay chart, and topping the Hot 100
    Singles Sales chart for four consecutive weeks. The song was a
    crossover success, reaching the top of the Rhythmic Top 40, and
    hitting the top twenty of the Hot Dance Club Play chart, and
    the top ten in the Hot Dance Singles Sales chart. It ended at
    number ten at the 1997 year-end chart.</p>
      <p>The Spice Girls were in Japan when "Wannabe" went to number
    one in the United Kingdom. The group made their first
    appearance on 
    <i>Top Of The Pops</i>by satellite link from Tokyo, where they
    used a local temple as a backdrop for their mimed
    performance.</p>
      <p>The song was included in the set list for both the
    Spiceworld Tour and the Christmas in Spiceworld tour. It was
    also performed several times on television, including 
    <i>Top Of The Pops</i>, 
    <i>Live with Regis and Kathie Lee</i>, 
    <i>Live &amp; Kicking</i>, 
    <i>Saturday Night Live</i>,
    <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show</i>, the 
    <i>Bravo Supershow</i>, and many television programs across
    Europe. "Wannabe" was also performed in many awards ceremonies
    like the 1996 Smash Hits! Awards, the 1996 Irish Music Awards,
    and the 1997 Channel V Music Awards held in India.</p>
      <p>"Wannabe" was usually introduced by Melanie Brown. During
    the bridge ("here's the story...") Melanie Chisholm did some
    acrobatics as in the video, always earning a big ovation from
    the public. After Halliwell left the band, her parts were
    replaced by Chisholm, Beckham, and Bunton this way:</p>
      <p>Lift ("tell me what you want..."): Chisholm, Verses ("get
    your act ... if you really..."): Beckham, Bridge ("easy V
    doesn't..."): Bunton</p>
      <p>The line "easy V doesn't come for free, she's a real lady"
    was altered for their Spiceworld Tour (for some shows) to "easy
    V doesn't come for free, 'cause she's havin' a baby!" For The
    Return of the Spice Girls tour, Halliwell sometimes replaced
    "she's a real lady!" with "she's Victoria Beckham!", "'cause
    she's Victoria" or "she's Miss Beckham!"</p>
      <p>These are the formats and track listings of major single
    releases of "Wannabe".</p>
