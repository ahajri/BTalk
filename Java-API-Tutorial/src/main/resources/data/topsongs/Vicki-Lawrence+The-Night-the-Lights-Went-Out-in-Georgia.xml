      <p>"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" is a Southern
    Gothic song written by songwriter Bobby Russell and performed
    in 1972 by his then-wife Vicki Lawrence; Reba McEntire later
    covered it in 1991.</p>
      <p>Recorded in late October 1972 in United/Western Studios on
    Sunset in Hollywood and released less than two weeks later in
    November 1972, the song centers around the older brother of the
    narrator.</p>
      <p>The lyrics are narrated by a young woman telling the story
    of her older brother (Raymond) who returns home after a
    two-week trip and meets his best friend (Andy Wolloe) at Webb's
    bar ("Andy Wolloe said hello, and he said 'Hi, what's doing
    Wo??'"). Andy informs him that Raymond's wife has been cheating
    on him with another man ("that Amos boy Seth"), and then for
    good measure Andy reveals that he too has been sleeping with
    his friend's wife. Raymond is understandably upset, which
    scares Andy so he leaves the bar and walks home. Finding his
    home empty, Raymond assumes his wife left town, so he gets his
    gun ("the only thing Daddy had left him") and heads out to
    murder Andy. When he arrives there, he finds small tracks
    outside the house ("tracks that were too small for Andy to
    make"), and discovers that someone has already killed Andy. He
    fires his gun in the air to summon a passing sheriff, but when
    he is found standing over the dead body with a smoking gun, he
    is arrested for murder. The sheriff and a judge convict him in
    a kangaroo court, and hang him that night at midnight,
    effectively lynching him. In the final verse, the singer then
    reveals that it was she ("little sister") who killed Andy, and
    that she also killed her promiscuous sister-in-law ("one body
    that'll never be found").</p>
      <p>Beyond simply the typical police corruption, the song
    relates that the judge is just as corrupt as the officer, and
    also heartless, when rendering the guilty verdict: 
    <i>slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile, said "supper's
    waiting at home and I gotta get to it"</i>(In the 1991 music
    video it is also alleged that the judge was also sleeping with
    the wife and wouldn't listen to the truth to protect himself,
    "Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his
    hands.").</p>
      <p>Originally, Bobby Russell did not want to even record a demo
    for the song because he didn't like it. Vicki Lawrence, his
    wife at the time, revealed the history of the song on her talk
    show in the 1990s when Reba McEntire was a guest on her show.
    According to Lawrence, she believed it was destined to be a hit
    and recorded the demo herself. The publisher didn't quite know
    where to pitch the song. The first thought was to pitch the
    song to Liza Minnelli. However, "The Night the Lights Went Out
    in Georgia" was first offered to Cher, but her then-husband and
    manager Sonny Bono reportedly turned it down (he was said to be
    concerned that the song might offend Cher's southern fans).</p>
      <p>Without an artist to record the song, Vicki Lawrence went
    into the studio to record the song for release. The song became
    a number-one hit for Lawrence (who was then a regular on 
    <i>The Carol Burnett Show</i>) on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100
    chart, and also reached the top forty of Billboard's Hot
    Country Singles chart. The song was number one for two weeks,
    being succeeded by Tony Orlando and Dawn's "Tie a Yellow Ribbon
    Round the Ole Oak Tree".</p>
      <p>Tanya Tucker recorded a different version for the 1981 film 
    <i>The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia</i>although with
    some altered lyrics which reflected the plot line of the movie,
    which is not the same as the story of the original song.</p>
      <p>"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" enjoyed a renewed
    push in popularity in 1991 when country music singer Reba
    McEntire released her own version of the song. The song,
    included on McEntire's 
    <i>For My Broken Heart</i>album, hit #12 on 
    <i>Billboard magazine'</i>s Hot Country Songs chart; the song
    also had a hit music video (which implied much more than the
    original Vicki Lawrence song) and has seen extensive airplay on
    The Nashville Network, GAC, and CMT.</p>
      <p>Another 11 years later, pop singer Taylor Horn covered
    McEntire's version of the song in 2002 for her album, 
    <i>taylor-made</i>. The song was also recorded by artist Daniel
    Selby in 1985 on his LP 
    <i>Finishing Touches</i>for Davis / Capitol.</p>
      <p>Vic Chesnutt recorded a version of the song for the 1994
    Star Power compilation album (contemporary artists covering
    1970s hits).</p>
      <p>Although not recorded, Jennifer Nettles of Sugarland
    performed the song on CMT Giants:REBA in honor of Reba
    McEntire.</p>
      <p>Also, Vicki Lawrence &amp; Reba McEntire performed it
    together on Vicki's talk show "Vicki."</p>
      <p>In a reference in popular culture, in 
    <i>The New Adventures of Old Christine</i>episode "Friends",
    Christine sings a misheard version of the song in the car
    scene.</p>
