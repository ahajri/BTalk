      <p>"I Will Follow Him" is a song recorded by Little Peggy
    March. The music was written by Frank Pourcel (using the
    pseudonym J.W. Stole) and Paul Mauriat (using the pseudonym Del
    Roma). The music was adapted by Arthur Altman and the English
    lyrics were written by Norman Gimbel.</p>
      <p>The song is a translation of the French language tune
    "Chariot" recorded a year earlier by Petula Clark, which hit #1
    in France and #8 in Belgium and earned Clark a gold record.
    (Clark's Italian and German recordings of the song were also
    major hits.)</p>
      <p>The song began as an instrumental piece, recorded in 1961 by
    Franck Pourcel, appearing on the 1961 European LP release:
    "Amour, Danse, Et Violons. No.17". At the same time, it also
    appeared on the EP release: "La Voix de son Maitre". Pourcel
    co-wrote the song with friend and fellow French bandleader Paul
    Mauriat. Franck Pourcel's original recording was popular on MOR
    or "easy listening" stations. Paul Mauriat himself later
    recorded an instrumental version in 1976 with a disco beat,
    using moog synthesizers.</p>
      <p>March's English version, backed with "Wind Up Doll", was
    released by RCA Victor and hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 on
    April 27, 1963, making 15-year-old March the youngest female
    artist to have a US chart-topping single. Her version also made
    it to #1 on the soul singles chart.</p>
