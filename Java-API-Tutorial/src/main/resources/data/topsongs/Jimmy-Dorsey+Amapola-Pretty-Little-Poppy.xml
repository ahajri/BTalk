      <p>"Amapola" is a popular song, written by Spanish composer
    Joseph LaCalle with Spanish lyrics although the English
    language lyrics were written by Albert Gamse.</p>
      <p>Though the song was published in 1924, the most popular
    recorded version was made nearly two decades later by the Jimmy
    Dorsey Orchestra with vocalists Helen O'Connell and Bob Eberly.
    The recording was released by Decca Records as catalog number
    3629. The record first reached the 
    <i>Billboard</i>charts on March 14, 1941 and lasted 14 weeks on
    the chart, peaking at #1.</p>
      <p>Another version, with vocals in English, was recorded by
    Spike Jonesand his City Slickers in the unforgettable comic
    style of his band. The flip-side was Jones Polka, a
    drinking-song, sung in a strong European accent.</p>
      <p>Japanese singer Noriko Awaya also released her version of
    the song in 1937. Amapola was also played during the Three
    Tenors concert in Rome in 1990.</p>
      <p>The song is also sung by Andrea Bocelli in his 2006 album
    Amore and by Paul Potts in his 2007 debut album One Chance.</p>
      <p>An instrumental version of the piece formed an important
    leitmotif in the gangster film 
    <i>Once Upon a Time in America</i>(1984).</p>
