      <p>"The Morning After" (aka "The Song from 'The Poseidon
    Adventure'") is an Academy Award-winning song, first released
    during May 1973. It was the first success for singer Maureen
    McGovern, and was used as the love theme for the film 
    <i>The Poseidon Adventure</i>, which was released late the year
    before.</p>
      <p>The song was written during March 1972 by 20th Century Fox
    songwriters Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn, who were told to
    write the love theme for 
    <i>The Poseidon Adventure</i>in one night. In the end, the
    finished product was called "Why Must There Be a Morning
    After?" but changes by management resulted in the song's more
    optimistic tone (as evidenced by the new cry of "There's got to
    be a morning after"). In the end titles of the film, it is
    officially called "The Song From 'The Poseidon Adventure'", not
    what would be its otherwise best known title, "The Morning
    After".</p>
      <p>The song is performed in the film by the character of Nonnie
    (actually a vocal double (Renee Armand) singing for Carol
    Lynley) as entertainment at the New Year's Eve party early in
    the film. The lyrics are relevant to the ensuing story
    developments in which several people survive the capsizing of
    the ship 
    <i>SS Poseidon</i>.</p>
      <p>Russ Regan, manager of 20th Century Records, suggested that
    Maureen McGovern, who had sent him a demonstration tape and was
    working at the time as a secretary, sing the song. Having the
    utmost faith in her, he financed the recording with his own
    money and contracted her to his company.</p>
