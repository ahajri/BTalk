      <p>Rock Me Gently was a song that was a Billboard #1 hit for
    Andy Kim in 1974. Despite the sexual innuendo of the title and
    verse, it has been called the "ultimate bubblegum teen-pop
    radio entry" of its time.</p>
      <p>The Canadian singer, who had achieved several hits from 1968
    to 1971, had not had a Top 100 single since September 1971, and
    had been without a record label since early 1973. Nevertheless,
    he said in a 1974 interview, "I never mentally admitted defeat
    in spite of three years off the charts". He formed his own
    label, 
    <i>Ice Records</i>, and personally financed the recording
    session that produced "Rock Me Gently". He could only afford to
    record two sides, and deciding the second side was good enough
    to be the A-Side of another single, he put an instrumental of
    Rock Me Gently on its B-Side.</p>
      <p>The single impressed Capitol Records executives, who signed
    Kim to a deal. The "Rock Me Gently" single debuted on the Hot
    100 on June 22, 1974, and took 14 weeks to reach #1 on
    September 28. It also rose to #2 on the UK Singles Chart. Even
    the instrumental B-Side received substantial airplay on R&amp;B
    stations. It would be Kim's last top 10 hit in either
    country.</p>
      <p>In 1989, Canadian country singer, Michelle Wright released
    at version as a single on her debut album, 
    <i>Do Right By Me</i>, and reached #7 on the Canadian RPM
    country singles chart.</p>
      <p>The song resurfaced in 2007 in a television commercial for
    Jeep Liberty.</p>
