      <p>"Torn Between Two Lovers" is the title of a pop song written
    by Peter Yarrow (of the folk music trio Peter, Paul &amp; Mary)
    and Phillip Jarrell. It was inspired by Boris Pasternak's 1957
    novel, 
    <i>Dr. Zhivago</i>, which featured a man in love with two
    women. Yarrow originally intended the song to be sung by a man.
    It was recorded by St. Paul, Minnesota-born singer Mary
    MacGregor in 1976, and was #1 on the U.S. pop and adult
    contemporary charts for two weeks in February of 1977. The song
    inspired the title of a TV movie aired in 1979, starring Lee
    Remick, George Peppard, and Joseph Bologna in which the song is
    played three times (over both credit sequences and during the
    actual film).</p>
      <p>The song was mentioned in Dolly Parton's 1984 top-twenty
    country single, "God Won't Get Ya'".</p>
