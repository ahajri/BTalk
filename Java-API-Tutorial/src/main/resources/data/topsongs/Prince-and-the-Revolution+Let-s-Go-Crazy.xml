      <p>"Let's Go Crazy" is a 1984 song by Prince and The
    Revolution, from the album, 
    <i>Purple Rain</i>. It was the opening track on both the album,
    and the film 
    <i>Purple Rain</i>. "Let's Go Crazy" is one of Prince's most
    popular songs, and is almost always a staple for concert
    performances, often segueing into other hits. When released as
    a single, the song became Prince's second number-one hit on the
    Billboard Hot 100, and also topped the two component charts,
    the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Dance Club Play charts,
    as well as becoming a UK Top 10 hit. The B-side was the
    lyrically controversial "". In the UK, the song was released as
    a double A-side with "".</p>
      <p>Common to much of Prince's writing the song is thought to be
    exhortation to follow Christian ethics, with the "De-elevator"
    of the lyrics being a metaphor for the Devil.</p>
      <p>The extended "Special Dance Mix" of the song was performed
    in a slightly edited version in the film 
    <i>Purple Rain</i>. It contains a longer instrumental section
    in the middle, including a solo on an apparently out-of-tune
    piano and some muddled lyrics, repeating the track's
    introduction.</p>
      <p>The song was also notable for opening with a funeral-like
    organ solo with Prince giving the "eulogy" for "this thing
    called life." That eulogy ends with a distinctive drum machine
    pattern and then quickly becomes a full hard rock number with
    heavy guitar, bass and synthesizers. The song's percussion was
    programmed with the venerable Linn LM-1 drum machine, an
    instrument frequently used in many of Prince's songs.</p>
      <p>In 2007, Stephanie Lenz, a writer and editor from Gallitzin,
    Pennsylvania made a home video of her 13-month-old son dancing
    to "Let's Go Crazy" and posted a 29-second video on the
    video-sharing site YouTube. Four months after the video was
    originally uploaded, Universal Music Group, which owned the
    copyrights to the song, ordered YouTube to remove the video
    enforcing the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</p>
      <p>Later in August 2008, U.S. District Judge Jeremy Fogel of
    San Jose, California ruled that copyright holders cannot order
    a deletion of an online file without determining whether that
    posting reflected "fair use" of the copyrighted material. Lenz
    notified YouTube immediately that her video was within the
    scope of fair use, and demanded that it be restored. YouTube
    complied after six weeks—not two weeks, as required by the
    Digital Millennium Copyright Act—to see whether Universal
    planned to sue Lenz for infringement. Lenz then sued Universal
    Music in California for her legal costs, claiming the music
    company had acted in bad faith by ordering removal of a video
    that represented fair use of the song.</p>
