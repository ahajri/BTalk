      <p>"Rag Doll" is a popular song written by Bob Crewe and Bob
    Gaudio. It was recorded by The Four Seasons and released as a
    single in 1964. The single reached number one on the U.S. pop
    chart in July of that year and remained in the top position for
    two weeks.</p>
      <p>The song was quite an accomplishment for Crewe and Guadio
    and the Four Seasons, ascending to the top of the charts during
    1964, "the year of The Beatles," a tough time for U.S.-based
    pop acts to have chart success.</p>
      <p>According to songwriter Bob Gaudio, the recording was
    inspired by the activities of a young girl as he was stopped in
    traffic in Manhattan. As he waited for the traffic signal to
    change, a dirty-faced girl proceeded to clean the windshield of
    his automobile for some spare change. When Gaudio reached into
    his wallet, he was surprised to find that all he had were notes
    , and none of the bills was smaller than $20. He gave the girl
    in tattered clothes a $20 bill. (The amount of the bill is
    unsure as Gaudio has also said it was a $5 and a $10 on
    different occasions). Her look of utter astonishment stayed in
    Gaudio's mind as he approached the recording studio. "Rag
    Doll", with a few tweaks by Bob Crewe, was the result.</p>
      <p>The B-side was the original version of "Silence Is Golden."
    In 1967 the song was a number one hit in the UK Singles Chart
    for the English band The Tremeloes.</p>
