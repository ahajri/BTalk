      <p>"Again" is a song by American singer Janet Jackson from her
    fifth studio album, 
    <i>janet.</i>(1993). Written and produced by Jackson, James
    Harris III, and Terry Lewis, the ballad was released as the
    album's third single in October 1993. "Again" topped the U.S.
    Hot 100 in late 1993 and received a nomination for the Academy
    Award for Best Original Song.</p>
      <p>Based on a lost love, "Again" was included as the closing
    song to her 1993 box-office film debut in 
    <i>Poetic Justice</i>. While not included on its soundtrack
    album, the song was nominated for Best Original Song at the
    66th Academy Awards, where Jackson performed the song live. The
    
    <i>janet.</i>jazz-funky track "Funky Big Band" appears on the
    single as a B-side. A French version of the song was also
    recorded by Jackson and appears on the CD single as well as the
    limited edition of the 
    <i>janet.</i>album. The track became her seventh number one on
    the Hot 100 chart, staying atop for two weeks.</p>
      <p>Jackson has performed the song on all of her tours,
    including the janet. Tour, The Velvet Rope Tour, All for You
    Tour, and Rock Witchu Tour.</p>
      <p>"Again" is set in common time with a key of C major.
    Jackson's vocal chords ranges between the tonal nodes of
    high-tone G
    <sub>3</sub>to low-tone D
    <sub>5</sub>. The song is in a moderate tempo of 64 beats per
    minute with the chord progression being set like C–Am–C–G/F–G
    in the first verse and C–Em–Am–G/F in the chorus.</p>
      <p>The music video for the song was directed by Jackson's
    then-husband René Elizondo, Jr. It features actor Gary Dourdan
    as Jackson's lost love, with Jackson writing in her diary as
    she reminisces about her love through flashbacks. The alternate
    version of the video contains scenes from 
    <i>Poetic Justice</i>playing on a television. The original
    video appears on the 1994 compilation 
    <i>janet.</i>and the 2004 DVD 
    <i>From janet. to Damita Jo: The Videos</i>, while the 
    <i>Poetic Justice</i>version is included on the 2001 DVD
    edition of 
    <i>All for You</i>.</p>
      <p>The song was sampled by Iyaz on his 2010 single, "Solo."</p>
