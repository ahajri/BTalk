      <p>"You Can't Hurry Love" is a number-one single originally
    recorded by The Supremes for the Motown label, released during
    the summer of 1966. Sixteen years later, the song again became
    a number-one hit when Phil Collins rerecorded the song, which
    reached number-one on the UK Singles Chart for two weeks
    beginning in January 1983.</p>
      <p>The song itself, a memory of a mother's words of
    encouragement ("My mama said 'you can't hurry love/No you just
    have to wait'") telling her daughter that with patience she
    will find that special someone one day, is an example of the
    strong influence of gospel music present in much of R&amp;B and
    soul music. "You Can't Hurry Love" also showcases the
    developing sound of The Supremes, who were progressing from
    their earlier teen-pop into more mature themes and musical
    arrangements. This song and "You Keep Me Hangin' On" were
    finished together; when it came time to choose which single
    would be issued first, Motown's Quality Control department
    chose "You Can't Hurry Love".</p>
      <p>Written and produced by Motown's main production team,
    Holland–Dozier–Holland, "You Can't Hurry Love" is one of the
    signature Supremes songs, and also one of Motown's signature
    releases. The single became The Supremes' seventh number-one
    hit, topping the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart for two weeks,
    from September 4, 1966 to September 17, 1966, and reaching
    number one on the soul chart for two weeks. The girl group
    performed the song on the CBS variety program 
    <i>The Ed Sullivan Show</i>on Sunday, September 25, 1966.</p>
      <p>"You Can't Hurry Love" was the second single from the
    Supremes' album 
    <i>The Supremes A' Go-Go</i>. It reached the #1 position on the
    Hot 100 pop chart in the United States, and #3 in the United
    Kingdom. The Supremes' version of the song is honored by
    inclusion in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's permanent
    collection of 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.</p>
      <p>Unlike many of the earlier Supremes records, "You Can't
    Hurry Love" has inspired significant cover versions. The most
    notable of these was released in late 1982 as a single by Phil
    Collins from his second solo album, 
    <i>Hello, I Must Be Going!</i>Collins' version reached
    number-one on the UK Singles Chart (becoming his first
    number-one solo hit in the UK and peaking two positions higher
    than the original song did in that country), and reached number
    10 in the United States. Although Collins had previously done
    covers as album tracks (of Genesis' "Behind the Lines" and The
    Beatles' "Tomorrow Never Knows" on Face Value), "You Can't
    Hurry Love" was the first cover he released as a single.
    Collins' version was the first track on the very first 
    <i>Now That's What I Call Music</i>CD. On the second repeat of
    the chorus, he replaces "How Much More Can I Take" with "How
    Much More Must I Take."</p>
      <p>Other notable recordings of "You Can't Hurry Love" include
    versions by Stray Cats, who released their cover as the
    flipside of their Rock This Town single and the Dixie Chicks
    (on the soundtrack of the film 
    <i>Runaway Bride</i>). Konami's GuitarFreaks/DrumMania Bemani
    music video game series also includes a cover, sung by Paula
    Terry. In the popular sitcom 
    <i>Sister, Sister</i>, Tia Mowry, her sister Tamera Mowry, and
    Alexis Fields cover the song. Carmen Rasmusen on Season 2 of
    American Idol, Brandon Rogers on Season 6, and Scott MacIntyre
    on Season 8 performed live covers of "You Can't Hurry
    Love".</p>
      <p>The song was also sung by Whoopi Goldberg's character in the
    1986 film Jumpin' Jack Flash, when she attempts to infiltrate a
    party at the British Embassy in New York, disguised as the
    evening's entertainment.</p>
      <p>The song is covered by the company Wavegroup for the game
    Karaoke Revolution Presents: American Idol Encore.</p>
      <p>During a weekend getaway on an episode of 
    <i>A Different World</i>, Ron, Dwayne, Kim, Freddie and Ernest
    sing "You Can't Hurry Love," with Whitley imitating deena Ross'
    stage persona.</p>
      <p>In 2008, Toni Gonzaga and Vhong Navarro did a duet version
    of the song. It was used as the soundtrack for their movie My
    Only U.</p>
      <p>In 2009, MySpace/DGC recording artist Meiko recorded a
    remake of the song for use in an ABC Family made-for-TV film
    titled My Fake Fiance.</p>
