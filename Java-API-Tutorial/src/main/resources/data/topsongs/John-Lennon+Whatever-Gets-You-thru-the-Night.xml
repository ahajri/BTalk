      <p>"Whatever Gets You Thru the Night" is a song on John
    Lennon's 1974 album 
    <i>Walls and Bridges</i>. It was Lennon's only American solo
    number one song during his lifetime. The recording featured
    Elton John on harmony vocals and piano. While in the studio,
    Elton bet Lennon that the song would top the charts, and such
    was Lennon's skepticism that Elton secured from him a promise
    to appear on stage at one of his performances should the record
    indeed hit number one. When the record did achieve that feat,
    Lennon appeared at Elton John's Thanksgiving performance at
    Madison Square Garden on November 28, 1974
    <span style="display:none"> (
    <span class="bday dtstart updated">

</span>)</span>. It would be his last major concert appearance.
Lennon was the last member of The Beatles to achieve his first
number one solo hit.</p>
      <p>The inspiration for the song came from late-night
    television. In December, 2005, May Pang told Radio Times: "At
    night he (John Lennon) loved to channel-surf, and he would pick
    up phrases from all the shows. One time, he was watching
    Reverend Ike, a famous black evangelist, who was saying, "Let
    me tell you guys, it doesn't matter, it's whatever gets you
    through the night." John loved it and said, "I've got to write
    it down or I'll forget it." He always kept a pad and pen by the
    bed. That was the beginning of 'Whatever Gets You thru the
    Night'."</p>
      <p>This wasn't Lennon's first choice for a single. It was
    actually chosen by Capitol Records vice president Al Coury, who
    had recently worked his singles 'magic' with Paul McCartney's 
    <i>Band On the Run</i>album.</p>
      <p>In 2007, Yoko Ono granted Amnesty International the
    opportunity to have a number of bands cover John Lennon's solo
    songbook, which includes this song. Los Lonely Boys and Les
    Trois Accords performed it as the second single from the 
    <i>Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save
    Darfur</i>album.</p>
