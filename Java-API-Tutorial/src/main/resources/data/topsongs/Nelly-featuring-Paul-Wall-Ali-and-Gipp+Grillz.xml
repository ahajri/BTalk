      <p>"Grillz" is a 2005 rap single from the album 
    <i>Sweatsuit</i>by Nelly featuring Paul Wall and Ali &amp; Gipp
    (a duo composed of Ali from the St. Lunatics and Big Gipp from
    the Goodie Mob) about grills, cosmetic dental apparatuses.
    Brandi Williams performs back-up vocals on "Grillz". In six
    weeks, "Grillz" reached the top five of the Billboard Hot 100,
    and number one in its tenth week (in 2006), becoming Nelly's
    fourth number one hit. It also became #1 on the Hot Ringtones
    chart. In the UK, it became his least successful single since
    "Iz U" charting at only #24. "Grillz" samples "Soldier" by
    Destiny's Child, a No. 3 Hot 100 hit for the group. Big Boi of
    OutKast makes a cameo appearance in the video. There is a remix
    featuring Chingo Bling on the album Dollarado 2 Texas. Another
    official remix is West Coast remix and it features Diamonique
    and Lil' Rob.</p>
