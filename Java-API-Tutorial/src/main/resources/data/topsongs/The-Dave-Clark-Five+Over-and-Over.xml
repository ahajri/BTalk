      <p>"Over and Over", written by Bobby Day and sung by lead
    singer and keyboardist Mike Smith, was the only U.S. #1 hit for
    the Dave Clark Five, one of the early British Invasion bands of
    the mid-1960s. It followed the group's signature sound of
    thumping, 4/4 drum beats accompanied by a wailing saxophone.
    Despite its success in the USA and the popularity of the group
    on both sides of the Atlantic, the single only reached number
    45 in the band's native United Kingdom.</p>
