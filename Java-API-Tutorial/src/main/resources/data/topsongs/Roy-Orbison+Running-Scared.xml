      <p>"Running Scared" is a 1961 American pop song written by Roy
    Orbison and Joe Melson and sung by Orbison. An operatic rock
    ballad, the song was released as a 45rpm single by Monument
    Records in March 1961 and went to number one on the Billboard
    Hot 100 chart.</p>
      <p>"Running Scared" also appears on Orbison's 1962 album titled
    
    <i>Roy Orbison's Greatest Hits</i>and (in a live version) on
    his 1989 posthumous album 
    <i>A Black &amp; White Night Live</i>from the 1988 HBO
    television special.</p>
      <p>Noted for being a song written without a chorus, the verse
    builds to a climax that, without vibrato, demonstrates the
    power of Orbison's clear, full voice. It is written in the
    bolero style; Orbison is credited with bringing this to the
    rock genre.</p>
      <p>While "Running Scared" was an international hit, the B-side
    "" also picked up significant airplay in Australia.
    Consequently, chart figures for Australia show "Running
    Scared"/"Love Hurts" as a double A-Side, both sides peaking at
    #5. This makes Orbison's recording of "Love Hurts" the first
    version to be a hit. "Love Hurts" would later become better
    known in a version by rock band Nazareth, who had an
    international hit with it in 1975.</p>
