      <p>"Black Cat" is the sixth single from American R&amp;B-pop
    singer Janet Jackson's fourth studio album, 
    <i>Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814</i>(1989).</p>
      <p>Unlike the R&amp;B- and pop-infused songs that Jackson had
    been releasing before, this song was strictly a rock and roll
    production solely written by Jackson and co-produced with one
    of the song's guitarists, Jellybean Johnson. The song became
    Jackson's fourth chart-topper on the Hot 100.</p>
      <p>Jackson has performed the song on all of her tours,
    including the Rhythm Nation 1814 Tour, janet. Tour, The Velvet
    Rope Tour, All for You Tour, and Rock Witchu Tour.</p>
      <p>For the album version of "Black Cat", most of the guitar
    lines were played by Dave Barry, including the intro, main
    riff, and a memorable thematic solo. Barry consequently became
    Janet Jackson's longtime touring guitarist. John McClain,
    executive for A&amp;M Records, provided the slide-guitar part,
    while Jellybean Johnson played the funky guitar part that
    punctuates the album version of the song. Although credited on
    the album, Jesse Johnson provided a guitar solo that was not
    used for the album version, but is featured in each of the
    remixes.</p>
      <p>Several "Black Cat" remixes include Nuno Bettencourt on
    rhythm guitar.</p>
      <p>The B-side on some of the releases features "The 1814
    Megamix". Remixed by Alan Coulthard, it includes snippets of
    Jackson's previous hit singles "Alright", "Escapade", "Rhythm
    Nation", and "Miss You Much". The megamix does not appear on
    any other release from Jackson.</p>
      <p>Directed by Wayne Isham, the video for "Black Cat" was a
    concert video from her Rhythm Nation 1814 Tour. The video
    appears on the video releases 
    <i>The Rhythm Nation Compilation</i>and 
    <i>Design of a Decade 1986/1996</i>. On April 27, 2007, the
    video was released on the iTunes Store.</p>
