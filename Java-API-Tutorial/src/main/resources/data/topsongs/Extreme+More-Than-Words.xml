      <p>"More Than Words" is a ballad written by and originally
    performed by the rock band Extreme. It is built around acoustic
    guitar work by Nuno Bettencourt and the vocals of Gary Cherone
    (with harmony vocals from Bettencourt), it was released in 1990
    on the album 
    <i>Extreme II: Pornograffiti</i>. The song was a departure from
    the funk metal that had permeated the band's style previous to
    its release.</p>
      <p>The song itself asks the person to whom it is addressed to
    show love through "more than words."</p>
      <p>The video for "More Than Words" was parodied by "Weird Al"
    Yankovic for his original song, "You Don't Love Me Anymore."
    Also Amateur Transplants wrote a comedic song to the same tune
    as "More Than Words" entitled "Northern Birds" which may be
    found on their 2006 album "We Are So Bad". The video was also
    parodied by Jason Segel and the cast of 
    <i>How I Met Your Mother</i>in an online tie-in music video for
    the episode "The Sexless Innkeeper".</p>
      <p>On March 23, 1991, "More Than Words" entered the U.S. Hot
    100 at number 81 and soon after reached number one. It also
    reached number two in the UK Singles Chart, where the group had
    had success before its American breakthrough. Though they had
    made a few European charts before, this brought the band to
    their first mainstream success in the United States. Extreme
    followed "More Than Words" with another power ballad, "Hole
    Hearted," which was slightly faster paced than "More Than
    Words", but nevertheless topped at number 4 in the United
    States and number 3 in Canada.</p>
