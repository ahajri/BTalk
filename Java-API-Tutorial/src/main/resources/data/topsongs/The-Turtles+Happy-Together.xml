      <p>"Happy Together" is a 1967 song from The Turtles' album of
    the same name. Released in spring of 1967, the song knocked The
    Beatles' "Penny Lane" out of the #1 slot for three weeks on the
    Hot 100. It was the group's only chart-topper. "Happy Together"
    reached #12 on the UK Singles Chart in April 1967. The song was
    written by Gary Bonner and Alan Gordon, former members of a
    band known as The Magicians.</p>

    sung by Roberto Jordan, called "Juntos y Felices". In 1999, BMI
    named "Happy Together", with approximately five million
    performances on American radio, the forty-fourth most-performed
    song in the USA of the 20th century, placing it in the same
    league as "Yesterday" by The Beatles and "Mrs. Robinson" by
    Simon and Garfunkel. Frank Zappa's performance on 
    <i>Fillmore East - June 1971</i>is especially notable: his band
    at the time included Turtles vocalists Howard Kaylan and Mark
    Volman and bassist Jim Pons. Kaylan and Volman also did a
    reggae remake of the song for the last Flo &amp; Eddie album: 
    <i>Rock Steady With Flo &amp; Eddie.</i>Hugo Montenegro's cover
    version was released as a single in 1969 and reached #29 on the
    
    <i>Billboard</i>Easy Listening chart. More recently, the song
    has been covered by B.E. Taylor for his latest album, 
    <i>Love Never Fails</i>, and by the Flobots. The song has also
    been sung by the Red Army Choir and the Leningrad Cowboys, as
    well as the English rock band Johnny Panic. It was also
    performed on the show 
    <i>American Idol</i>on February 19, 2008, by David Cook, and on
    February 20, 2008, by Brooke White. In 2007 the song was used
    as a sample on the song "Ooh Ooh Baby" from Britney Spears'
    album 
    <i>Blackout</i>. This song has also been covered by the Roamin'
    Bones of the Florida State University Marching Band, the
    Marching Chiefs.</p>
