      <p>"Boogie Fever" is a song performed by Memphis,
    Tennessee-based R&amp;B group The Sylvers, from their 1975
    album 
    <i>Showcase</i>. Their most lucrative single, it reached number
    one on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot Soul Singles charts
    in 1976, and was their third of nine Top 20 R&amp;B hits and
    first top 40 pop single.</p>
      <p>The narrator of the song notes a change that seems to have
    come over his girlfriend - at the drive-in movie, she turns
    down the speaker volume and turns up the radio to hear her
    favorite disco songs, and "boogies" to the disco beat while
    eating her meal at the pizza parlor. He concludes that his girl
    must have caught the "boogie fever" which seems to be "goin'
    around." In the final verse, he consults his doctor and
    realizes that he, too, has caught the "boogie fever" as a
    result of dancing all night "doin' the bump, bump, bump" with
    his girlfriend.</p>
      <p>After being signed to Capitol Records in 1975, Larkin
    Arnold, then vice president, hired Motown Records veteran
    Freddie Perren to produce the group. Kenneth St. Lewis, a
    long-time collaborator with Arnold, suggested they write a song
    for them using one of the popular words of the day, "boogie."
    The song featured all nine Sylvers, including the youngest
    sisters, Angelia and Pat. Released in February 1976, it took 13
    weeks to climb to number-one on the pop charts.</p>
