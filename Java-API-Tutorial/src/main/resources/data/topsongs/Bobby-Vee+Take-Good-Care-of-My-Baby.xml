      <p>"Take Good Care of My Baby" is a song written by Carole King
    and Gerry Goffin and made famous by Bobby Vee, when it was
    released in 1961. It quickly became popular, reaching #1 on the
    U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in September. The song was covered by
    The Beatles during their audition at Decca Records on January
    1, 1962. Dion also recorded a version, though it was not
    released as a single. Gary Lewis &amp; The Playboys recorded a
    cover version in 1965 on their 
    <i>She's Just My Style</i>album. In 1968, it became a hit
    again, this time for Bobby Vinton, but his version reached only
    #33 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in comparison. Vee
    re-recorded the song as a ballad in 1973 on his album 
    <i>Ain't Nothing Like a Sunny Day</i>(released under his real
    name, Robert Thomas Velline). However, it's his original
    version, along with Vinton's, that remain as staples of oldies
    radio stations.</p>
      <p>It has also been covered by Smokie (Solid Ground, 1981) and
    German Pop Star Sasha (Dick Brave and the Backbeats, 2003).</p>
