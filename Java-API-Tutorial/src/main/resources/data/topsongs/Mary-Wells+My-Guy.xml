      <p>"My Guy" is a 1964 number-one hit single recorded by Mary
    Wells for the Motown label. Written and produced by Smokey
    Robinson of The Miracles, the song is a woman's dedication to
    the goodness of her man 
    <i>("There's not a man today who could take me away from my
    guy")</i>.</p>
      <p>The single became the biggest hit ever for Wells, Motown's
    first female star, and reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100
    pop singles chart. The song led the Cashbox Magazine R&amp;B
    chart for seven weeks . "My Guy" also happened to be Wells'
    last hit single for Motown, excepting duets she recorded with
    label mate Marvin Gaye. An option in her recording contract
    allowed Wells to terminate it at her discretion after she
    reached her twenty-first birthday on May 13, 1964. Encouraged
    by her ex-husband, Wells broke her Motown contract and signed
    with 20th Century Fox in hopes of higher royalties and possible
    movie roles. However, Wells' career never again reached the
    heights it had at Motown, and she never again had a hit single
    as big as "My Guy".</p>
      <p>As one of Motown's signature hits, "My Guy" has been covered
    often, with versions by The Supremes, Sister Sledge, Petula
    Clark, Claudine Longet, Aretha Franklin, Margo Smith, and more
    having been recorded over the years. The cover version of the
    song with the biggest chart impact in the United States was by
    Sister Sledge in 1982 (#23). One notable cover, used in the
    Whoopi Goldberg film 
    <i>Sister Act</i>, substitutes "My Guy" with "My God",
    transforming the song into a faux-gospel number. In 1980, Amii
    Stewart and Johnny Bristol recorded it as a duet in a medley
    with another Motown classic, the Temptations' "My Girl"; it
    reached only #63 in the U.S. Wells herself re-recorded the song
    in a funk rendition for her 1984 album, 
    <i>I'm a Lady</i>.</p>
      <p>In 1999, "My Guy" was inducted to the Grammy Hall of
    Fame.</p>
