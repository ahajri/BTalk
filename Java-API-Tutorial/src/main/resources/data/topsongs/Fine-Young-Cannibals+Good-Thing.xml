      <p>"Good Thing" is a song recorded by Fine Young Cannibals, the
    second single pulled from their album 
    <i>The Raw &amp; the Cooked</i>. The song was their second U.S.
    number one, topping the Billboard Hot 100 on July 8, 1989. It
    also peaked at #7 on the UK singles chart.</p>
      <p>The song made its first appearance in the 1987 film 
    <i>Tin Men</i>. Fine Young Cannibals portrayed a nightclub band
    in the movie, performing this song and three others (including
    the single's b-side "Social Security"). The film is set in
    Baltimore in 1963, and the song's retro-soul style is
    consistent with that setting.</p>
      <p>The video features many scenes with motor scooters, both at
    rest and in motion as well as scooter culture. The scooters
    featured include stock scooters, as well as highly stylized
    scooters and minimalist cutdown scooters.</p>
      <p>The song was used in an advert for the Chevrolet Captiva SUV
    automobile in the United Kingdom. It was also used in the 2008
    film 
    <i>Doomsday</i>, starring Rhona Mitra, in a surreal scene
    involving the film's main antagonist.</p>
