      <p>"One More Night" is the first single from Phil Collins'
    third album, 
    <i>No Jacket Required</i>. It has also been released as the
    eleventh track on the 1998 compilation album, 
    <i>Hits (Phil Collins album)</i>, as well as the third track on
    the 2004 compilation album, 
    <i>Love Songs: A Compilation... Old and New</i>. "One More
    Night" was Phil Collins' second U.S. number-one single,
    following "Against All Odds", and was his fourth single to
    reach the top ten in the UK, peaking at number four on the
    singles chart.</p>
      <p>Collins was playing around with his drum machine when he
    started saying the chorus of the song. He later recalled that
    "The rest of the song was written very quickly." The video
    features Collins playing the piano in a downtown bar. The music
    video for the song was filmed at a pub owned by Richard Branson
    in London (much like the video for Sussudio). Its B-side in the
    UK was "I Like the Way", while the U.S. received "The Man with
    the Horn".</p>
      <p>Robert Hilburn of the 
    <i>Los Angeles Times</i>originally disliked the song "One More
    Night", but later praised the song, saying that "Collins'
    soulful but polite vocal style is also capable of capturing the
    pain of going through yet one more night without her." Isaac
    Guzman of the New York Daily News said that the song brought
    about "snuggle-inspiring tenderness".</p>
      <p>However, Keegan Hamilton of the 
    <i>Riverfront Times</i>said that the song was the worst track
    on the album, saying that "The album's introspective slow jam
    wallows in self-pity." "It's minimalist, as far as the '80s go,
    relying mostly on a shaker, a crisp drum machine and echoing
    keyboards. It ends with a saxophone solo so smooth that I can't
    believe it's not butter," adds Keegan.</p>
      <p>The song has also been an occasional cover song for
    ex-Veruca Salt frontwoman, Nina Gordon during live appearances.
    An extended version of the song appeared on the 
    <i>12"ers</i>album.</p>
      <p>Dancehall artist, Busy Signal, also has a covor to this song
    and converted it with a reggae spin to it.</p>
