      <p>"I Can't Believe You Love Me", (Terrell, 1966)</p>
      <p>"Your Precious Love", (Terrell, 1967)</p>
      <p>"Ain't No Mountain High Enough" is an R&amp;B/soul song
    written by Nickolas Ashford &amp; Valerie Simpson in 1966. The
    composition was first successful as a 1967 hit single recorded
    by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell for the Tamla (Motown) label.
    The song became a hit a second time in 1970, when a cover by
    fellow Motown artist Diana Ross became a number-one hit on the
    Hot 100 chart and was nominated for a Grammy Award.</p>
      <p>The original 1967 version of "Ain't No Mountain High Enough"
    was a top twenty hit. According to record producers, Terrell
    was a little nervous and intimidated during recording because
    she hadn't rehearsed the lyrics. Terrell recorded her vocals
    alone with producers Harvey Fuqua and Johnny Bristol, who added
    Gaye's vocal at a later date. "Ain't No Mountain" peaked at
    number nineteen on the Billboard pop charts, and went to number
    three on the R&amp;B charts.</p>
      <p>This original version of "Ain't No Mountain", produced by
    Fuqua and Bristol, was a care-free, danceable, and romantic
    love song that became the signature duet between Gaye and
    Terrell. Its success led to a string of more Ashford/Simpson
    penned duets (including "You're All I Need to Get By", "Ain't
    Nothing Like the Real Thing", and "Your Precious Love").</p>
      <p>The Gaye/Terrell version was inducted into the Grammy Hall
    of Fame in 1999, and is regarded today as one of the most
    important records ever released by Motown.</p>
      <p>After the Top 20 success of her first single, "Reach Out and
    Touch (Somebody's Hand)", Ashford and Simpson had Ross
    re-record "Ain't No Mountain High Enough". Initially, Ross was
    apprehensive, as she had previously covered the song as a
    member of the Supremes in a duet with The Temptations(see
    below). Eventually, however, she was convinced to make the
    recording. The new cover re-imagined Gaye and Terrell's duet as
    a dramatic six-minute opus, composed primarily of spoken word
    passages from Ross, with the Andantes, Jimmy Beavers, and
    Ashford and Simpson as backing singers.</p>
      <p>Motown chief Berry Gordy didn't like the record upon first
    hearing it. He hated the spoken-word passages and wanted the
    song to begin with the climactic chorus/bridge. It was not
    until radio stations nationwide were editing their own versions
    and adding it to their playlists that Ashford and Simpson were
    able to convince Gordy to release an edited three-minute
    version as a single. Ross' version of "Ain't No Mountain High
    Enough" rose up to number one on both the pop and R&amp;B
    singles charts., and Ross received a Grammy nomination for Best
    Female Pop Vocal Performance. Ross's version was later sampled
    in Jadakiss's song Can't Stop Me.</p>
      <p>With The Supremes, Diana Ross recorded a version of "Ain't
    No Mountain High Enough" which was more faithful to the
    Terrell-Gaye original version as a duet with The Temptations.
    That song was an album cut from a joint LP released by Motown
    Records in 1968 on the two superstar groups, titled 
    <i>Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes Join The Temptations</i>.</p>
      <p>1981 saw the recording by Inner Life of the underground
    dance classic "Ain't No Mountain High Enough", produced by
    Patrick Adams and Greg Carmichael, remixed by Larry Levan, and
    released on the Salsoul label. The same year saw an upbeat
    disco version by the Boys Town Gang who recorded it as a medley
    with another Ashford &amp; Simpson song, "Remember Me". The
    full version of this song is nearly 14 minutes long and can be
    found on their album 
    <i>Cruisin the Street</i>.</p>
      <p>Stacy Lattisaw and Howard Hewett sang "Ain't No Mountain
    High Enough" on 
    <i>Personal Attention</i>album in 1988.</p>
      <p>Australian Rock legend Jimmy Barnes released a Motown-styled
    album, titled 
    <i>Soul Deep</i>, in 1991 with twelve covers; one of them was
    his rock version of "Ain't No Mountain High Enough". This cover
    reached #28 in Australia in 1992</p>
      <p>In 1993, at the end of the film 
    <i>Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit</i>, Whoopi Goldberg and
    most of the cast of the movie, including future neo-soul
    superstar Lauryn Hill, mixed both the Gaye/Terrell and Diana
    Ross solo versions of the song together for a performance of
    "Ain't No Mountain" at the climax of the film. The Gaye/Terrell
    version also frequently turns up, often as part of a
    sing-along, in "feel-good" movies, such as 
    <i>Remember the Titans</i>and 
    <i>Stepmom</i>.</p>
      <p>Former Doobie Brother Michael McDonald recorded the song as
    part of his 
    <i>Motown</i>album in 2003. The version was used in a
    commercial for MCI and in the film 
    <i>The 40-Year-Old Virgin</i>.</p>
      <p>In 2004, the 12 finalists of American Idol (season 3)
    covered the song for the ensemble track for the cast album
    American Idol Season 3: Greatest Soul Classics</p>
      <p>Swedish pop band Play recorded the song for their 2003 album
    
    <i>Replay</i>. This version appeared in the trailer for the
    2006 film 
    <i>Last Holiday</i>.</p>
      <p>In 2006, Australian vocal group Human Nature included a
    cover on the 2nd album of their Motown trilogy, Dancing in the
    Street: the Songs of Motown II. The album debuted at #1 on the
    ARIA charts.</p>
      <p>In 2006, Amy Winehouse recorded the song "Tears Dry On Their
    Own" for her album 
    <i>Back to Black</i>, which keeps the melody and
    instrumentation of "Ain't No Mountain High Enough", but which
    contains different, original lyrics written by Winehouse.</p>
      <p>Portions of the song were interpolated on the Jessica
    Simpson single "A Public Affair".</p>
      <p>In 2009, Lionel Richie and Stefanie Heinzmann performed the
    song live in the German music award show Echo 2009.</p>
