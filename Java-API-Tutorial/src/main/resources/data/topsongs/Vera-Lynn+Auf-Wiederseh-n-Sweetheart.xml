      <p>"Auf Wiederseh'n Sweetheart" is a popular song and a cover
    version of "Auf wiedersehen, auf wiedersehen" written by German
    composer Eberhard Storch.</p>
      <p>The English language lyrics were written by John Turner and
    Geoffrey Claremont Parsons. The best-known version of the song
    was recorded by English singer Vera Lynn. The story goes that
    Vera was on holiday in Germany and heard people singing the
    song in a pub, and when she got back she felt she had to record
    it, so found the music and had lyrics written.</p>
      <p>The recording of the song by Vera Lynn which featured
    accompaniment by Soldiers, Sailors and Airman of HM Forces, was
    the first song recorded by a foreign artist to make #1 on the
    Billboard charts, in 1952.</p>
      <p>, The song was written by Eberhard Storch in hospital for
    his wife Maria as he was long time ill. So far as I remember he
    said to me in the 1970'ies, as he was my teacher, that he knew
    the CIO of a large US record company who was a pilot and
    captured in the 2.nd world war. This one helped him to publish
    the song in the US., A lot of broadcasts and TV shows in
    Germany ends since the fifties with this song.,</p>
