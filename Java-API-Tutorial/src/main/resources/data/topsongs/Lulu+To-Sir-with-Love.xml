      <p>"To Sir, with Love" is the theme from the 1967 film 
    <i>To Sir, with Love</i>. The song was written by Don Black and
    Mark London.</p>
      <p>"To Sir, with Love" was initially recorded by Lulu (with The
    Mindbenders, who also acted in the film). Her single was
    released in 1967 and reached number one on the Billboard Hot
    100, remaining in the top position for five weeks and earning
    the number one position for the entire year. "To Sir With Love"
    also peaked at number nine on the R&amp;B charts .</p>
      <p>In Lulu's native UK, the song was never released in its own
    right, instead appearing as the B-side to the 1967 #11 hit
    "Let's Pretend."</p>
      <p>Australian singer Tina Arena released her version of the
    song as the first single from her 2007 album 
    <i>Songs of Love &amp; Loss</i>.</p>
