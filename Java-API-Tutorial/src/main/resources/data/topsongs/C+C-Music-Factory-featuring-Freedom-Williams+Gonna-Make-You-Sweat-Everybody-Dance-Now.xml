      <p>"Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)" was C+C Music
    Factory's first hit. It was released in late 1990 in many
    countries and achieved a great success in U.S., Austria,
    Germany and Switzerland where it reached #1 on the charts.</p>
      <p>The rap was performed by Freedom Williams and the vocal
    "Everybody Dance Now" by Disco/House Music artist Martha
    Wash.</p>
      <p>Wash, perturbed by the fact that her image had been labeled
    "unmarketable" because of her obesity, successfully sued to
    receive proper credit (and royalties). Wash's courtroom efforts
    spurred legislation making vocal credits mandatory on CDs and
    music videos.</p>
      <p>When it was first released, "Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody
    Dance Now)" was met by widespread commercial recognition,
    initiating the house movement of the early '90s. Topping charts
    in several countries, the song dominated the airwaves while its
    accompanying music video received constant rotation on MTV.
    Music critics praised "Gonna Make You Sweat" for Freedom
    Williams' Ice-T-like rap delivery in conjunction with Martha
    Wash's powerful, exuberant, post-disco vocals and deemed the
    song as a bona fide classic. However, over the years, the song
    came to be used and/or referenced an innumerable amount of
    times by entertainment industry, to the point were it became
    something of a musical, pop culture cliché. By 2007, the song
    was criticized by Allmusic as "the lazy Hollywood "go-to" song
    for supposed laugh-filled, irony-fueled dance numbers."</p>
      <p>The song held the top spot in the 
    <i>Billboard Magazine</i>list of popular dance club tunes for
    five weeks in December 1990, and topped Billboard's Hot 100
    Singles list for two weeks in 1991 (February 9 and February
    16.) It reached #3 in the UK in January, a full month before
    its American pop success.</p>
      <p>Was featured in the Chevy Chase and Jonathan Taylor Thomas
    movie 
    <i>Man of the House</i>in an Indian dance sequence.</p>
      <p>The video featured dancers performing in front of a white
    back drop. Zelma Davis lip-synchs to the recorded vocals of
    Martha Wash. A short clip on Double Dutch is shown near the
    end.</p>
