      <p>"Rock Your Baby" is a popular song by George McCrae. Written
    and produced by Harry Wayne Casey and Richard Finch of KC and
    the Sunshine Band, "Rock Your Baby" was one of the landmark
    recordings of early disco music. A massive international hit,
    the song reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 singles
    chart in the USA, spending two weeks at the top in July 1974,
    number one on the R&amp;B singles chart, . and repeating the
    feat on the UK singles chart, spending three weeks at the top
    of the chart in July 1974. In total it sold over 11 million
    copies internationally.</p>
      <p>The backing track for the record had been recorded in 45
    minutes as a demo, and featured guitarist Jerome Smith (June
    18, 1953 - July 28, 2000) of KC and the Sunshine Band. The
    track was not originally intended for McCrae, but he happened
    to be in the studio, added a vocal, and the resultant
    combination of infectious rhythm and falsetto vocals made it a
    hit.</p>
      <p>The hit song later inspired a reply hit "Rockin' Chair" sung
    by Gwen McCrae then-wife of George McCrae released one year
    later on TK's Cat subsidiary label with the music and
    arrangements sounding almost near-similar.</p>
      <p>The song has been covered by Italian singer Spagna in her
    2004 album 
    <i>L'arte di arrangiarsi</i>.</p>
