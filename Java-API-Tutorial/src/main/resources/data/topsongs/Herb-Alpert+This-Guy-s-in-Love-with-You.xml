      <p>"This Guy's in Love with You" is a song written by Burt
    Bacharach and Hal David and recorded by Herb Alpert. Although
    known primarily for his trumpet playing as the leader of the
    Tijuana Brass, Alpert sang lead vocals on this solo recording,
    arranged by Bacharach.</p>
      <p>Alpert originally sang "This Guy's in Love with You" on a
    1968 television special (
    <i>The Beat of the Brass</i>). In response to numerous viewer
    telephone calls, the song was released as a single and reached
    #1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in June of that year,
    remaining in the top position for four weeks. It was not only
    Alpert's first #1 record, but it was also the first #1 record
    for his A&amp;M record label. The song also spent an impressive
    ten weeks at #1 on the adult contemporary chart, which at the
    time was referred to as the "Easy Listening" chart. For the
    single's B-side, Alpert chose "A Quiet Tear," an album track
    from his first album in 1962, 
    <i>The Lonely Bull</i>.</p>
      <p>Eleven years later Alpert would become the first (and only)
    artist to reach the top of the Hot 100 with both a vocal
    performance and an instrumental performance ("Rise", 1979).</p>
      <p>Larry Goldings Trio cover the tune on the album 'Sweet
    Science'</p>
