      <p>"I Went to Your Wedding" is a popular song written by Jessie
    Mae Robinson and published in 1952.</p>
      <p>The song is a report of a wedding, attended by the ex-lover
    of one of the parties being married, who obviously is still in
    love with the person it is addressed to. While the lines "You
    came down the aisle/ Wearing a smile/ A vision of loveliness"
    might suggest the song being directed to a female, the
    best-known versions of the song have been sung by female
    singers, presumably to male ex-lovers.</p>
      <p>The biggest hit version was recorded by Patti Page. It was
    recorded on August 6, 1952, and issued by Mercury Records as
    catalog number 5899, with the flip side "You Belong to Me." It
    first entered the Billboard chart on August 22, 1952, lasting
    21 weeks and reaching #1 on the chart.</p>
      <p>Another version was recorded by the Sammy Kaye orchestra, on
    August 15, 1952, and issued by Columbia Records as catalog
    number 39856. The song was also recorded by Alma Cogan in the
    United Kingdom in 1952.</p>
      <p>It was then famously 'spoofed' by Spike Jones and his City
    Slickers later in the decade. The lines quoted above were
    altered thus: "You tripped down the aisle/ Fell flat on your
    (laughter) smile/ Your father was loaded too". The male
    ex-lover (Jones' vocalist) is in fact now interpreted to be
    glad to "get rid" of the bride!</p>
