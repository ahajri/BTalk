      <p>"The Gypsy" is a popular song written by Billy Reid, and
    published in 1945.</p>
      <p>"The Gypsy" was originally introduced in the United Kingdom
    by Reid's orchestra and vocalist Dorothy Squires. In the United
    States, the song was recorded by The Ink Spots, by Dinah Shore,
    and by Sammy Kaye's orchestra, becoming a hit for all
    three.</p>
      <p>The Gypsy was also recorded by Charlie Parker on July 29,
    1946, during the famous "Lover" session after which he was
    committed to the Camarillo State Mental Hospital in California.
    In addition to Charlie Parker's version, there were two
    recordings done by Quincy Jones: "The Birth of The Band" year
    1959 and in the early '60s "Quincy Jones and His Band: Vol. 1",
    both albums featuring Phil Woods.</p>
      <p>A more recent version, by Memphis record producer and
    performer Jim Dickinson was included in his 1997 release 
    <i>A Thousand Footsteps in the Sand</i>, actually recorded in
    1992.</p>
      <p>This song has recently been featured in the 2008 movie 
    <i>Revolutionary Road</i>starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate
    Winslet.</p>
      <p>The song tells the story of a person who regularly visits a
    Gypsy, who comforts them by telling them that their lover has
    been faithful, though as the song says, the person knows that
    Gypsy is wrong and that their lover has been unfaithful.</p>
