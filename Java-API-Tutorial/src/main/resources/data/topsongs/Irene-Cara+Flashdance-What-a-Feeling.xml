      <p>"Flashdance... What a Feeling" is an Academy Award winning
    song from the 1983 film 
    <i>Flashdance</i>, written by Giorgio Moroder, Keith Forsey,
    Irene Cara and which was performed by Cara.,</p>
      <p>In addition to topping the Billboard Hot 100 and earning a
    platinum record in 1983, "Flashdance... What a Feeling" won the
    Academy Award for Best Original Song and the Golden Globe Award
    for Best Original Song in 1984. Despite the title, the word
    "Flashdance" is never used in the lyrics. The instrumental
    backing tracks of the song make extensive use of
    synthesizers.</p>
      <p>"Flashdance......What a Feeling" was originally recorded by
    Joe Esposito before Irene Cara was asked to rerecord, since it
    would be from a women persective.</p>
      <p>The song has appeared on the original soundtrack album of 
    <i>Flashdance</i>, and Irene Cara's second solo album, 
    <i>What a Feelin'</i>. The song also won the Grammy Award for
    Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female in 1984. It was also
    nominated for Record of the Year.</p>
      <p>A variation of the song was used as the basis of an Apple
    corporate video in 1984. The music was slightly different, and
    the lyrics were changed from "What a Feeling" to "We are
    Apple".</p>
      <p>There are additional lyrics in the 12-inch single version of
    the song. The lines "
    <i>If I only could take all the love that you give, and escape
    to a world crystal clear</i>" precede the lines "
    <i>Well I hear the music, close my eyes, feel the rhythm</i>".
    There is also a second instrumental break with a guitar
    solo.</p>
      <p>The song ranks at #26 on 
    <i>Billboard's All Time Top 100.</i>
      </p>
      <p>In the UK, the song spent one week at #2 on the chart dated
    July 5, 1983, being kept off the top position by the Rod
    Stewart's song "Baby Jane." The song was the 25th best-selling
    single of 1983 in the UK.</p>
      <p>The song was the number 3 single of the year (1983) on
    Billboard's year-end chart. American Top 40 ranked it as the
    number two song of 1983.</p>
      <p>The soundtrack album has the version that is usually played
    by radio stations. The song appears twice in the film, during
    the opening title sequence and as the backing for Alex's
    audition routine in the final sequence. Both of these versions
    were recorded specially for the film, and have different
    arrangements from the album version.</p>
      <p>Irene Cara's song was used in an Australian Beer Commercial.
    It depicts a man auditioning for a job as a beer brewer and
    uses a similar dance routine that was used in the film. The
    advertisement was for Carlton Draught beer.</p>
      <p>Since the early 2000s, 
    <i>What a Feeling</i>has been used in advertisements for
    heartburn relief medicine Gaviscon.</p>
