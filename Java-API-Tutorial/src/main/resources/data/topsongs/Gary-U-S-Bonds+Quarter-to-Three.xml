      <p>"Quarter to Three" is a popular song adapted and expanded
    from "A Night With Daddy 'G' - Part 2" (Legrand LEG 1004)), an
    instrumental by The Church Street Five which was written by
    Gene Barge, Frank Guida and Joseph Royster, and sung by Gary
    U.S. Bonds. The song became a Billboard number-one hit in the
    United States on June 26, 1961 and remained there for two
    weeks.</p>
      <p>The 45 single of "A Night With Daddy 'G'" identifies the
    composers by their last names only -- Barge, Guida, Royster --
    and identifies the music publisher as Pepe Music (BMI).</p>
      <p>The song was sung regularly by Bruce Springsteen as an
    encore before he was famous and remained in his repertoire
    afterward, appearing on the 
    <i>Hammersmith Odeon London '75</i>concert document and, as
    performed in 1979, the 
    <i>No Nukes</i>film.</p>
      <p>"Quarter to Three" appears on The Rock and Roll Hall of
    Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll list.</p>
