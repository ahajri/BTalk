      <p>"My Heart Will Go On" is the theme song of the 1997
    blockbuster film 
    <i>Titanic</i>. With music by James Horner, lyrics by Will
    Jennings, and production by Walter Afanasieff, it was recorded
    by Céline Dion. Originally released in 1997 on Dion's album 
    <i>Let's Talk About Love</i>, it went to number 1 all over the
    world, including the United States, United Kingdom and
    Australia. 
    <i>My Heart Will Go On</i>was released in Australia and Germany
    on December 8, 1997, and in the rest of the world in January
    and February of 1998. It became one of the best-selling singles
    of all time, and was the world's best selling single of
    1998.</p>
      <p>Horner had originally composed the song as an instrumental
    motif that is used in several scenes during 
    <i>Titanic</i>. He then wanted to make a full vocal song out of
    it, for use in the end credits of the film. Director James
    Cameron did not want such a song, but Horner went ahead anyway
    and got Jennings to write the lyrics. Dion was Horner's first
    choice to sing it, but when she heard the song, she did not
    want to record it. It was her manager and husband, René
    Angélil, who convinced her to record a demo version, which was
    something she hadn't done for many years. Horner waited until
    Cameron was in an appropriate mood before presenting him with
    the song. After playing it several times, Cameron declared his
    approval, although worried that he might be criticised for
    "going commercial at the end of the movie."</p>
      <p>The song was recorded in one take and without instrumental
    accompaniment. Horner, Dion, and later Sony Music Entertainment
    decided to use this first recording because "Dion's voice was
    perfect."</p>
      <p>The music video was directed by Bille Woodruff and released
    at the end of 1997. It was included later on the 
    <i>All the Way… A Decade of Song &amp; Video</i>DVD.</p>
      <p>In addition to Dion's 
    <i>Let's Talk About Love</i>and the 
    <i>Titanic</i>soundtrack, "My Heart Will Go On" appears on
    several other albums, including 
    <i>Au cœur du stade</i>, 
    <i>All the Way… A Decade of Song</i>, 
    <i>A New Day... Live in Las Vegas</i>, 
    <i>Complete Best</i>and 
    <i>My Love: Essential Collection</i>. It was also included on
    the following DVDs: 
    <i>Au cœur du stade</i>, 
    <i>All the Way… A Decade of Song &amp; Video</i>and 
    <i>Live in Las Vegas - A New Day...</i>.</p>
      <p>At the height of the song's popularity, some radio stations
    in the U.S. and the UK played an edited version of the song,
    that had dramatic moments of dialog from the Jack and Rose lead
    characters in the film inserted in between Dion's vocal lines.
    It was included later on 
    <i>Back to Titanic</i>second soundtrack album.</p>
      <p>In France, "My Heart Will Go On" was released as a double
    A-side single with "The Reason."</p>
      <p>"My Heart Will Go On" is Céline Dion's biggest hit and one
    of the best-selling singles in history. In the U.S. the song
    debuted at number 1 on the Hot 100 and stayed in that position
    for 2 weeks. It spent 10 weeks at number 1 on the Hot 100
    Airplay and was also number 1 for 2 weeks on the Hot 100
    Singles Sales. Only a limited number of copies were released –
    690,000 – which were sold out in a few days. The single was
    eventually certified gold in the U.S. The song also became
    number 1 on several other U.S. charts: Hot Adult Contemporary
    Tracks (for 10 weeks), Top 40 Mainstream (10 weeks), Hot Latin
    Pop Airplay (4 weeks) and Hot Latin Tracks (1 week). "My Heart
    Will Go On" was the first English-language song to top the Hot
    Latin Tracks chart and Dion was given a Latin Music Award for
    that achievement.</p>
      <p>"My Heart Will Go On" was number 1 all over the world,
    spending many weeks at the top position, including: 17 weeks on
    the Eurochart Hot 100 Singles, 15 weeks in Switzerland, 13
    weeks in France and Germany, 11 weeks in the Netherlands and
    Sweden, 10 weeks in Belgium Wallonia, Denmark, Italy and
    Norway, 7 weeks in Belgium Flanders, 6 weeks in Ireland, 4
    weeks in Australia and Austria, 2 weeks in Spain and the UK,
    and 1 week in Finland.</p>
      <p>In Germany, "My Heart Will Go On" has sold over 2 million
    copies and was certified 4x platinum, becoming currently the
    87th best-selling single of all time there. It has also sold
    over a million copies in the United Kingdom (1,315,000) and
    France (1,200,000), and became 2x platinum and diamond single
    respectively. Other certifications include: 3x platinum in
    Belgium (150,000), 2x platinum in Australia (140,000),
    Netherlands (150,000), Norway (40,000), Sweden (40,000),
    Switzerland (100,000), platinum in Greece (40,000) and gold in
    Austria (25,000). "My Heart Will Go On" was released twice in
    Japan. The regular edition from January 1998 has sold 210,000
    and was certified 2x platinum (200,000). The remixes edition
    from June 1998 has sold 115,000 and was certified separately
    gold (100,000) due the fact that maxi-singles are treated as an
    album.</p>
      <p>"My Heart Will Go On" won the 1997 Academy Award for Best
    Original Song. It dominated the Grammy Awards of 1999, winning
    Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Female Pop Vocal
    Performance and Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion
    Picture or Television. "My Heart Will Go On" won also the
    Golden Globe Award for "Best Original Song-Motion Picture" in
    1998.</p>
      <p>The song also won a Japanese Gold Disc Award, for Song of
    the Year, as well as a Billboard Music Award for Soundtrack
    Single of the Year.</p>
      <p>In a 2006 poll for a program on Five called 
    <i>Britain's Favourite Break-up Songs</i>, "My Heart Will Go
    On" was voted tenth. It has been named one of the Songs of the
    Century. It is one of the best-selling singles ever in the UK.
    It was ranked at number 14 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs,
    celebrating the 100 greatest songs in American film
    history.</p>
      <p>Due to the song's widespread popularity when it was
    released, it is considered to be Céline Dion's signature song.
    Today, along with two other songs from film soundtracks,
    Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You" from 
    <i>The Bodyguard</i>and Bryan Adams' "(Everything I Do) I Do It
    for You" from 
    <i>Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves</i>, it is considered one of
    the biggest love ballads of the 1990s.</p>
      <p>After the song had become a huge worldwide hit, many movie
    studios and record labels tried to duplicate its impact.
    Although many soundtrack singles had become hits before "My
    Heart Will Go On," a string of similar songs followed
    afterward, such as Aerosmith's "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing"
    from 
    <i>Armageddon</i>and Faith Hill's "There You'll Be" from 
    <i>Pearl Harbor</i>. Each followed in the footsteps of the
    "Titanic" theme, a love ballad for a tragedy. Although those
    two songs became hits, they did not achieve the success of "My
    Heart Will Go On."</p>
      <p>Horner himself repeated the formula of making a song from
    his film themes with movies such as 
    <i>A Beautiful Mind</i>, 
    <i>Bicentennial Man</i>, 
    <i>The Perfect Storm</i>, and 
    <i>Avatar</i>.</p>
