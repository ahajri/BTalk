      <p>"Hearts of Stone" is an American R&amp;B song. It was
    written by Rudy Jackson, a member of the San Bernardino,
    California-based rhythm and blues vocal group the Jewels (no
    relation to the female Jewels group from Washington, DC) which
    first recorded it for the R&amp;B label in 1954. The Jewels
    began as a gospel group, then became the Marbles, recording for
    the Lucky label out of Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>According to Johnny Torrence, leader of the Marbles/Jewels,
    it was taken from a song they recorded in their gospel days.
    "Hearts of Stone" was covered and taken to the charts by East
    Coast R&amp;B vocal group The Charms, causing the story of the
    Jewels' involvement to be ignored by various writers and DJs
    who assume the Charms cover was the original. The Charms
    version of the song went to number one on the R&amp;B Best
    Sellers and number fifteen on the pop charts.</p>
      <p>It also has been recorded by:</p>
      <p>Anita, June, Helen and Mother Maybelle Carter performed a
    memorable live version of this song on an appearance filmed in
    color by Albert Gannaway in Nashville in the mid-1950s. Red
    Foley opened both the first and last programs of 
    <i>Ozark Jubilee</i>with the song.</p>
