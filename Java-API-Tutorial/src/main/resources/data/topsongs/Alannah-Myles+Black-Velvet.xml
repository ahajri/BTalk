      <p>"Black Velvet" is a rock song written by Canadian musicians
    David Tyson and Christopher Ward, and recorded by Canadian
    singer Alannah Myles in 1989. It became a number one hit on the
    Hot 100 charts in 1990 and reached number one on the Album Rock
    Tracks chart, as well as number one in Canada and number two in
    the UK Singles Chart. In 1990, country music artist Robin Lee
    reached number 12 on the U.S. country singles charts with a
    cover version.</p>
      <p>The song is about Elvis Presley. The words "black velvet"
    can refer to either his likeness frequently being painted on
    black velvet or his voice. Also, Black Velvet (full name
    "Sullivan's Black Velvet Hair Dye") is what Elvis used to give
    his naturally brown hair its distinctive black sheen. Black
    velvet is described as a "new religion that'll bring y'all to
    your knees" (changed to "bring you to your knees" in the Robin
    Lee version). The chorus tells of "Black velvet in that little
    boy's smile/Black velvet with that slow, Southern style" and
    the end of the first verse claims that "The boy could sing,
    knew how to move, everything/Always wanting more, he'd leave
    you longing for [black velvet]".</p>
      <p>While the first verse discusses the beginning of Elvis' life
    - "Mama's dancing with baby on her shoulder" - the second talks
    about the height of his career - "Mama's baby is in the heart
    of every schoolgirl; Love Me Tender leaves 'em crying in the
    aisles". The final verse references his death - "In a flash he
    was gone, it happened so soon, what could you do?"</p>
      <p>The song appears on the game Karaoke Revolution Presents:
    American Idol Encore.</p>
      <p>The song is about broken hearts, and drinking it away (black
    velvet is a Canadian whiskey).</p>
      <p>Country music artist Robin Lee, also signed to Atlantic at
    the time, covered "Black Velvet" in 1990 on her third studio
    album, also titled 
    <i>Black Velvet</i>. Lee's version peaked at #12 on the U.S. 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks (now Hot
    Country Songs) chart. Her rendition, which changes the line
    "bring y'all to your knees" to "bring you to your knees", is
    also her highest chart peak.</p>
