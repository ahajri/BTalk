      <p>"Love Hangover" was the fourth number one single for Motown
    singer Diana Ross. It was released in March 1976, and rose to
    number one on the Billboard Hot 100, Hot Soul Singles and Hot
    Dance Club Play charts simultaneously.</p>
      <p>Written by Pamela Sawyer and Marilyn McLeod, the song had
    been originally recorded by the The 5th Dimension as a disco
    number. The Motown staff believed that it would be perfect for
    Ross to record. Ross, like her soul contemporaries Aretha
    Franklin and Marvin Gaye, initially resented the new musical
    movement but eventually agreed to record the song.</p>
      <p>Producer Hal Davis instructed the song's engineer Russ
    Terrana to install a strobe light so that Ross could be in the
    "disco" mindset. As the song changed from ballad to uptempo,
    Ross became more comfortable with the material; she hummed,
    sang bit parts, laughed, danced around and even imitated Billie
    Holiday. The carefree and sensual nature of Ross' vocals and
    the music's direction helped to sell the song.</p>
      <p>When The 5th Dimension and Ross both released the tune
    simultaneously, Ross's version charted higher. By the time
    "Love Hangover" went to number one, Ross had reinvented herself
    as a disco diva and the 5th Dimension's version had peaked at
    number 80. It won Ross a Grammy nomination for Best R&amp;B
    Female Vocal Performance.</p>
      <p>Motown released versions of Ross's version in 1988 (remixed
    by the British team PWL) and 1993 (remixed by Frankie Knuckles
    for the album 
    <i>Diana Extended: The Remixes</i>and by Joey Negro for a
    single).</p>
      <p>Almighty Records released a remixed version in 2007 (remixed
    by the UK team Almighty).</p>
      <p>In addition to being covered by the 5th Dimension, the song
    was also released as a single by the Associates, a British
    New-wave band. It reached #21 on the UK chart in 1982. Players
    Association also covered the track in 1977.</p>
      <p>British soul singer Pauline Henry (former lead vocalist of
    "The Chimes") recorded a contemporary version of the track in
    1995 (released as a single); singer Jody Watley recorded a
    downtempo version for her 2006 album, The Makeover; while
    Australian singer-songwriter Tina Arena recorded a version in
    2007 for her album 
    <i>Songs of Love &amp; Loss</i>.</p>
      <p>Mariah Carey performed the song in a concert tribute to
    Diana Ross (2000), and Stephanie Edwards sang it on the sixth
    season of 
    <i>American Idol</i>.</p>
      <p>The song would become part of the hip-hop lexicon via
    sampling by Will Smith, Master P, Monica, Janet Jackson, Bone
    Thugs-N-Harmony, French artist MC Solaar and Emily King, who
    made use of it for her 2007 debut album, East Side Story, in
    the song 
    <i>Walk in My Shoes</i>.</p>
      <p>Guns N' Roses lead singer Axl Rose sang the chorus of "Love
    Hangover" during an instrumental interlude in the song "If the
    World" on the Asian leg of the Chinese Democracy World Tour
    2009/2010.</p>
      <p>Mariah Carey performed a mix of "Love Hangover" and her #1
    single "Heartbreaker" on her Angels Advocate Tour between 2009
    and 2010.</p>
