      <p>"I'll Be There for You" is a Billboard Hot 100 number one
    single written by Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora and performed
    by American rock band Bon Jovi.</p>
      <p>Originally released on the 1988 album 
    <i>New Jersey</i>, it became the band's third single from the
    album when it was released as a single in 1989. As the band
    (and hard rock music) was at its peak popularity at this time,
    the song quickly climbed to the number one position on the
    Billboard Hot 100, becoming their fourth and final number one
    single. The song has remained as one of Bon Jovi's signature
    songs and a classic in the power ballad genre. The song was
    also a peek into a more mature sound heard on their following
    albums Keep the Faith and These Days.</p>
      <p>The video for the song features the band performing on a
    dark stage with an almost monochromatic blue color due to the
    stage lighting, with close-ups of each member, most notably
    lead singer Jon Bon Jovi and guitarist Richie Sambora. The
    video footage then switches midway to black-and-white footage
    from a Bon Jovi concert at the old Wembley Arena in London,
    England.</p>
