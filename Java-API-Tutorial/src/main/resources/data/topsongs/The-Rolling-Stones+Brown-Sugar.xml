      <p>"Brown Sugar" is a song by English rock band The Rolling
    Stones. It is the opening track and lead single from the band's
    1971 album 
    <i>Sticky Fingers</i>. 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>magazine ranked it #490 on their list of
    the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.</p>
      <p>Though credited, like most Rolling Stones compositions, to
    singer Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards, the song were
    primarily the work of Jagger, who wrote it sometime during the
    filming of 
    <i>Ned Kelly</i>in 1969. Originally recorded over a three day
    period at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Muscle Shoals, Alabama
    during 2–4 December 1969, the song was not released until over
    a year later due to legal wranglings with the band's former
    label though at the request of guitarist Mick Taylor, they
    debuted the number live during the infamous concert at Altamont
    on 6 December. In the film 
    <i>Gimme Shelter</i>, an alternate mix of the song is played
    back to the band while they relax in a hotel in Alabama. This
    version differs from that on record by the inclusion of a
    rhythmic variation on the familiar staccato introduction for
    two out of every four bars for that part and it includes a
    guitar solo by Mick Taylor rather than Bobby Keyes' sax
    solo.</p>
      <p>The song, with its prominent blues-rock riffs, dual
    horn/guitar instrumental break, and danceable rock rhythms, is
    representative of the Stones' definitive mid-period and the
    tough, bluesy hard-rock most often associated with the group.
    In the liner notes to the 1993 compilation album 
    <i>Jump Back</i>, Jagger says, "The lyric was all to do with
    the dual combination of drugs and girls. This song was a very
    instant thing, a definite high point." In the 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>interview (December 14, 1995, RS 723) with
    Mick Jagger, Jagger spoke at length about the song, including
    claiming credit writing the lyrics for the entire song, the
    inspiration and success of the song. He attributed the success
    of the song to a “good groove”. After noting that the lyrics
    meant so many lewd subjects, he again noted that the
    combination of those subjects, and the lyrics ambiguousness was
    partially why the song was considered successful. He noted,
    “That makes it...the whole mess thrown in. God knows what I’m
    on about on that song. It’s such a mishmash. All the nasty
    subjects in one go….I never would write that song now.” When
    Jann Wenner asked him why, Jagger replied, “I would probably
    censor myself. I’d think, 'Oh God, I can’t. I’ve got to stop. I
    can’t just write raw like that.'” , The lyrical subject matter
    has often been a point of interest and controversy. Described
    by rock critic Robert Christgau as "a rocker so compelling that
    it discourages exegesis", "Brown Sugar"'s popularity indeed
    often overshadowed its scandalous lyrics, which were
    essentially a pastiche of a number of taboo subjects, including
    interracial sex, cunnilingus, slave rape, and less distinctly,
    sadomasochism, lost virginity, and heroin.</p>
      <p>An alternate version was recorded on 18 December 1970, at
    Olympic Studios in London, after (or during) a birthday party
    for Richards. It features appearances by Al Kooper on piano,
    and Eric Clapton on slide guitar. The alternate version is
    widely available on bootleg recordings. Richards considered
    releasing this version on 
    <i>Sticky Fingers</i>, mostly for its more spontaneous
    atmosphere, but decided on the original.</p>
      <p>"Brown Sugar" was eventually released in May 1971 as the
    first single from the album, becoming a number-one hit in the
    United States and a number two hit in the United Kingdom and
    has since become a classic rock radio staple. While the
    American single featured only "Bitch" on the B-side, the
    British single featured that track plus a live rendition of
    Chuck Berry's "Let It Rock", recorded at the University of
    Leeds during the 1971 tour of the UK.</p>
      <p>The song was performed routinely during the Rolling Stones'
    1970 European Tour, occupying a prominent spot near the end of
    the set list even though audiences were unfamiliar with it. It
    eventually opened the famed 1972 American Tour shows and has
    been a Stones concert stalwart since.</p>
      <p>When the Rolling Stones perform "Brown Sugar" live, Jagger
    often changes the lyrics from, "Just like a young girl should,"
    to, "Just like a young man should." The line, "Hear him whip
    the women just around midnight," is often changed to the less
    offensive, "You shoulda heard him just around midnight." This
    is evidenced in their live albums 
    <i>Love You Live</i>, 
    <i>Flashpoint</i>, 
    <i>Live Licks</i>and 
    <i>Shine a Light</i>. This change even occurs on the version
    recorded at Richards' birthday party.</p>
      <p>The song is also notable for being the first single released
    on Rolling Stones Records (catalogue number RS-19100) and is
    one of the two Rolling Stones songs (along with "Wild Horses")
    licensed to both the band and former manager Allen Klein (a
    result of various business disagreements) resulting in its
    inclusion on the compilation album 
    <i>Hot Rocks 1964–1971</i>. "Brown Sugar" is also included on
    the most significant latter-day Rolling Stones compilations, 
    <i>Jump Back</i>and 
    <i>Forty Licks</i>.</p>
      <p>The song was later used in a 1998 Pepsi commercial with a
    fly singing a cover version of "Brown Sugar" after sipping on
    some spilled Pepsi. The commercial was used as part of Pepsi's
    aggressive ad campaign of switching to a blue background on its
    cans &amp; bottles after decades of using a white
    background.</p>
