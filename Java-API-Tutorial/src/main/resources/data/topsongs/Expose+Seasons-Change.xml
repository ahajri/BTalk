      <p>"Seasons Change" is a pop–R&amp;B song written and produced
    by Lewis Martineé for the American girl group Exposé's debut
    album, 
    <i>Exposure</i>(1987). Released in 1988 as the album's fourth
    single, the ballad remains the group's biggest hit to date, as
    it topped the U.S. Hot 100 for one week on February 20, 1988.
    The single also reached number ninety-seven in the United
    Kingdom. This song's lyrics describe relationships fading away
    due to the changes brought about by time (on both people and
    events). It is something of a sentimental break-up song, though
    not about any person in particular. It's not typical of this
    group's dance-pop-oriented sound, yet it remains their biggest
    hit to date.</p>
      <p>Angie Vollaro of fellow Lewis A. Martineé group Sequal lent
    background vocals to this song.</p>
