      <p>"Calcutta" was written in 1960 by Heino Gaze (music) and
    Hans Bradtke (lyrics). An instrumental recording of the tune by
    Lawrence Welk on the 1961 Dot Records album 
    <i>Calcutta!</i>was a chart hit, possibly the largest hit of
    Welk's career.</p>
      <p>The song, which in fact does have lyrics, was something of a
    departure for Welk with its combination of his recognizable
    "trademarks," i.e., the harpsichord lead, but backed with an
    accordion, handclaps and a brisk rock rhythm.</p>
      <p>"Calcutta" would stay atop the pop charts for two weeks
    while the album, with its combination of easy listening tunes
    and covers of then-popular rock singles, charted at number one
    for three months. At the time that "Calcutta" reached number
    one, Welk, who was then 57, became the oldest artist to have a
    number one pop single in the U.S. (His record would be broken
    three years later by Louis Armstrong who, at 62, topped the
    singles charts with "Hello, Dolly!" in early 1964.)</p>
      <p>Dancers Bobby Burgess and Barbara Boylan, cast members on
    Welk's weekly TV show, worked up a dance routine to go along
    with "Calcutta", which they would perform to the song numerous
    times on the 
    <i>Welk</i>show.</p>
