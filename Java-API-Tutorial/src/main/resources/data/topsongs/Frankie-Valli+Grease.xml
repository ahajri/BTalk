      <p>"Grease" is the title song for the musical motion picture 
    <i>Grease</i>, which was based on the stage play of the same
    name. The song was sung by Frankie Valli and was featured twice
    on the film's soundtrack; as the first track, and reprised as
    the final track. It became a number one single in the United
    States during 1978 and it also became a Top 30 R&amp;B hit in
    the same year. The song was written by Barry Gibb of the Bee
    Gees; that group would later perform the song in concert, as
    captured on their live offering 
    <i>One Night Only</i>. After "Grease" hit #1 on the Billboard
    Hot 100, Barry broke the record for '#1 Songs Written in a
    Calendar Year.' He was responsible for writing or co-writing 7
    #1 songs in 1978, breaking the record of 6 set by
    Lennon/McCartney in 1964. The other songs were "If I Can't Have
    You" (an Yvonne Elliman hit), "Stayin' Alive", "Night Fever",
    "How Deep is Your Love" (Bee Gees hits), "(Love Is) Thicker
    Than Water", and "Shadow Dancing" (Andy Gibb hits.)</p>
      <p>"Grease" was covered by experimental rock band Dog Fashion
    Disco and included as a hidden track on their album 
    <i>Committed to a Bright Future</i>and sampled in the track "I
    Want You" by Paris Hilton on her first studio album as well as
    "Rock The Party", a 2001 single by UK boy band Five. Part of
    the song was also interpolated in "Joints &amp; Jam", a 1998
    single by Black Eyed Peas as well as being heard in the song
    Blue Angels by Pras released in the same year. The song was
    also covered by UK girl group Girls Aloud. The song was also
    sampled by De La Soul on their 1991 song "A Roller Skating Jam
    Named 'Saturdays'".</p>
