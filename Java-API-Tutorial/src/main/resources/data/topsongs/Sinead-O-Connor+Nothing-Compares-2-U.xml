      <p>"Nothing Compares 2 U" is a song written in the 1980s by
    Prince for The Family. In 1990, a recording of the song by
    Sinéad O'Connor became a number-one hit in many countries,
    charting in the U.S., UK, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland,
    Canada, and Germany, and launched O'Connor's mainstream career.
    The subject of the song is actress Susannah Melvoin.</p>
      <p>In 1985, The Family, a funk band created as an outlet to
    release more of Prince's music, released their first and only
    album, the self-titled 
    <i>The Family</i>. "Nothing Compares 2 U" appeared on the
    album, but was not released as a single and received little
    recognition.</p>
      <p>Irish singer Sinéad O'Connor re-recorded the track in 1989
    and included it on her second album 
    <i>I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got</i>, bringing the song to
    worldwide prominence. The song's music video was a hit on MTV.
    The single topped the charts worldwide, including the United
    States, UK and Australia. The song also topped the U.S. Modern
    Rock Tracks chart. O'Connor's version was listed at #77 on 
    <i>Billboard'</i>s "Greatest Songs of All Time and at #10 on
    VH1's "100 Greatest Songs of the 90s".</p>
      <p>Due to the popularity of the O'Connor recording, Prince
    began to perform the song in concert, and included a live duet
    between himself and Rosie Gaines on his 1993 compilations 
    <i>The Hits/The B-Sides</i>and 
    <i>The Hits 1</i>. Prince also recorded a solo version of the
    song for his 2002 live album, 
    <i>One Nite Alone... Live!</i>.</p>
      <p>Mainly shot in Paris, the video for "Nothing Compares 2 U"
    was directed by John Maybury. The clip consists almost solely
    of a closeup on O'Connor's face as she sings the song's lyrics.
    Towards the end of the video, two tears roll down her face, one
    per cheek. O'Connor stated on VH1's 
    <i>100 Greatest Songs of the 90s</i>that it was caused by the
    lyric "All the flowers that you planted, Mama/in the back
    yard/All died when you went away", because she had a very
    complex relationship with her late mother, who she claims
    abused her. The clip won Best Video at the 1990 MTV Video Music
    Awards – the first video by a female artist to win in this
    category.</p>
