      <p>"Drop It Like It's Hot" is a 2004 rap number-one hit single
    by Snoop Dogg featuring Pharrell. Snoop performs the chorus and
    the second and third verses (of three). Pharrell performs the
    first verse which includes a line from his song "Raspy Shit"
    from his album 
    <i>In My Mind</i>. It was produced by The Neptunes and contains
    vocal samples from Laid Back's "White Horse".</p>
      <p>It was a Billboard number one hit for three weeks from
    December 11, 2004, making it Snoop Dogg's first number one on
    the Hot 100. The song also gave him his first number one on the
    Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It has reached #10 in the UK
    Singles Chart.</p>
      <p>It has won at the MTV Australia Video Music Awards 2006 the
    award for the best hip hop video and a MOBO Award for Best
    Video in 2005. A remix for this song was also produced by The
    Neptunes, but only was noticed in the underground scene.</p>
      <p>The song gained some critical attention for its very sparse
    production, which was essentially just tongue clicks, keyboards
    and a drum machine beat which, compared to much early 2000s
    rap, was very minimalist. It was nominated at the Grammy Awards
    of 2005 for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or
    Group, though it lost both awards to the songs "Jesus Walks"
    and "Let's Get It Started", respectively. The single is
    Pharrell's biggest hit worldwide (his highest peaking solo
    single would be "Frontin'".)</p>
      <p>There are two Radio Edits for the song: one is a standard
    Radio Edit that removes profanities and drug references while
    the other is an "Extra Clean" Radio Edit that removes gun
    references as well.</p>
      <p>On December 11, 2009, the song was named the most popular
    "Rap Song" of the decade by Billboard.</p>
      <p>The first known instance of the phrase "drop it like it's
    hot" on record is on Positive K's 1992 album 
    <i>The Skills Dat Pay Da Bills</i>, in the song "Ain't No
    Crime." The existence of the expression "drop it like it's hot"
    in modern pop culture comes from its use by Lil' Wayne as a
    guest rapper on Juvenile's 1999 hit single "Back That Azz Up".
    Lil' Wayne also has a song called "Drop It Like It's Hot",
    which was released later the same year. Jay-Z said "drop it
    like it's hot" in the song "Cashmere Thoughts" off his 1996
    album, 
    <i>Reasonable Doubt</i>. Wayne's single "Lollipop" featuring
    the late Static Major was sampled from former Cash Money
    ex-mate of the same name on 2008's 
    <i>Tha Carter III</i>.</p>
      <p>Since the 1990s, and especially after the success of Snoop
    Dogg's single, the expression became a common phrase among
    adolescents and young adults. Outside of hip-hop, it was also
    the title of a song on indie rock band Minus the Bear's 2002 EP
    
    <i>Bands Like It When You Yell "Yar!" at Them</i>. In 2000,
    Actor Cedric The Entertainter says "Drop it Like It's Hot" in
    the film 
    <i>Big Momma's House.</i>On Dogg's "That's That" featuring R.
    Kelly features the line of the previous single of the same name
    on his 2006 landmark album 
    <i>The Blue Carpet Treatment</i>. The Song Samples the First 10
    seconds of 
    <i>That Word (L.O.V.E.)</i>by The Rockmelons.</p>
      <p>The music video of the single is shot in monochrome with
    every scene following and depicting the respective lyrics. It
    was directed by Paul Hunter.</p>
