      <p>"Island Girl" is a song performed by Elton John that went to
    number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US and number 14 in
    the UK in 1975. It was the first single taken from the album 
    <i>Rock of the Westies</i>. The lyrics are about a prostitute
    and a man who wants to take her back to Jamaica.</p>
      <p>The song is atmospheric, featuring gospel-ish piano behind
    the famous scratchy, distorted repeated slide guitar intro. It
    also features a high-strung Caribbean guitar sound,marimbas,
    and a heavy bass guitar. Also notable is a shaky synthesizer
    solo played by James Newton Howard.</p>
      <p>The single's B-Side was "Sugar on the Floor", which was
    written by Kiki Dee, who would go on to duet with Elton on a
    number of occasions, most notably on their chart-topping 1976
    single, "Don't Go Breaking My Heart".</p>
