      <p>"Let Me Love You" is the first single from Mario's 2004
    album 
    <i>Turning Point</i>.</p>
      <p>It was produced by Scott Storch, and co-written by Shaffer
    Smith and Scott Storch. The remix of the song, also produced by
    Storch, contains rapped verses from Jadakiss and T.I..</p>
      <p>The song is listed at #45 on 
    <i>Billboard's All-Time Top 100</i>Hot 100 singles during the
    first 50 years of the chart and was the 8th most successful
    single of the decade according to the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot 100 Songs of the Decade.</p>
      <p>"Let Me Love You" is a moderate R&amp;B ballad set in the
    keys of F minor. It is written in common time.</p>
      <p>In 2004, "Let Me Love You" was nominated for a Vibe Award
    for Best R&amp;B Song and two Teen Choice Awards, Choice Love
    Song and Choice R&amp;B/Rap Track, but it failed to receive any
    awards. In 2005, it received nominations for Billboard Music
    Awards, including "Hot 100 Single of the Year", "Hot 100
    Airplay Single of the Year", "Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Single of the
    Year", "Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Airplay Single of the Year, winning
    in both the R&amp;B categories. It was also nominated for an
    MTV Europe Music Award for Best R&amp;B Single, a Viewer's
    Choice award at the BET Awards, Best Single at the MOBO Awards,
    and Best R&amp;B/Soul Song at the Soul Train Music Awards. In
    2006, Mario was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Male
    R&amp;B Vocal Performance with "Let Me Love You". He also
    received an MTV Australia Awards nomination for Best R&amp;B
    music video for "Let Me Love You".</p>
      <p>Jon Parales from New York Times "Let Me Love You", looks
    back to another 1980's blockbuster, lifting its keyboard sound
    from Tina Turner's "What's Love Got to Do With It." But the
    music isn't retro.</p>
      <p>The music video was directed by Little X.</p>
      <p>It held the number-one position on the U.S. Billboard Hot
    100 chart for nine weeks from January to March 2005, and is
    Mario's biggest single to date. It also reached number two on
    the UK Singles Chart, becoming his biggest hit there as well.
    It also reached number one on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs
    chart. The single holds the honor of being one of the
    highest-selling ringtones to date with 1.6 million
    downloads.</p>
