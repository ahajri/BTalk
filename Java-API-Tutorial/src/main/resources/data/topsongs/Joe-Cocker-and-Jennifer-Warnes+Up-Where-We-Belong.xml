      <p>"Up Where We Belong" is a song from the 1982 film 
    <i>An Officer and a Gentleman</i>. Written by Jack Nitzsche and
    Buffy Sainte-Marie, with lyrics by Will Jennings, it was
    performed by Joe Cocker and Jennifer Warnes.</p>
      <p>The single, released by Island Records in 1982, became a
    number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 on November 6, 1982
    and kept the position for three weeks, also reaching number 7
    in the UK, where the film was less popular.</p>
      <p>"Up Where We Belong" won the Golden Globe Award for Best
    Original Song and the Academy Award for Best Original Song in
    1983. It also won the BAFTA Film Awards for Best Original Song
    in 1984. Cocker and Warnes also won the Grammy Award for Best
    Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal in 1983 for their
    rendition of this song.</p>
      <p>The song's composer, Buffy Sainte-Marie, did a cover of the
    song for her album 
    <i>Up Where We Belong</i>and the TV special of the same
    name.</p>
      <p>Producer Don Simpson unsuccessfully demanded "Up Where We
    Belong" to be cut from 
    <i>An Officer and a Gentleman</i>, saying, "The song is no
    good. It isn't a hit."</p>
      <p>The song was part of the 
    <i>An Officer and a Gentleman</i>Original Soundtrack, and was
    later released as part of 
    <i>The Best of Joe Cocker</i>(1993).</p>
      <p>In 1991, it was re-released as a Jennifer Warnes CD-single
    alongside "First We Take Manhattan" and "(I've Had) The Time of
    My Life".</p>
      <p>The song also featured in the TV advertising campaign for
    Rover's 200 Series range on its launch in 1989.</p>
