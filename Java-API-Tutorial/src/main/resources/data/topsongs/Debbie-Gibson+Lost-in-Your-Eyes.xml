      <p>"Lost in Your Eyes" is the sixth single from American
    singer-songwriter, Debbie Gibson, and the first from her second
    album, 
    <i>Electric Youth</i>. Released in October 1988, the power
    ballad climbed to number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100
    singles chart and remained there for three weeks, becoming her
    most successful single. Additionally, it reached number three
    on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. The song was written
    by Gibson in late 1987 and published by Creative Bloc Music,
    Ltd. and Deborah Ann's Music in early 1988 (rights now
    administered by the Music Sales Corporation (ASCAP)). A beta
    arrangement had been performed on the 
    <i>Out of the Blue Tour</i>.</p>
      <p>One variant mixed from the original multitrack, "Lost in
    Your Eyes" (Piano and Vocal Mix/3:34), was only available in
    Europe as Track 3 of the CD3 release #A8970CD. The song is
    mentioned by name in Kimya Dawson's, "Caving in," as the
    singer's preferred alternative to "Unchained Melody".</p>
      <p>In 2006, Gibson rearranged her hit song with Tim and Ryan
    O'Neill for the O'Neill Brothers album 
    <i>Someone You Love,</i>where the resulting "Lost in Your Eyes
    (Acoustic Version)" became an album track.</p>
