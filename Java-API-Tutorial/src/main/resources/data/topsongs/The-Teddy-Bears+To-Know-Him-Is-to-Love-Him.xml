      <p>"To Know Him Is to Love Him" is a song written by Phil
    Spector, inspired by words on his father's tombstone. It was
    first recorded by his first vocal group, the only one of which
    he was a member, the Teddy Bears. Their recording went to
    number one on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in 1958. The
    Beatles recorded it as "To Know Her Is to Love Her" and Marc
    Bolan and Gloria Jones, Peter and Gordon, and Bobby Vinton made
    versions called "To Know You Is to Love You". In 1987, the song
    was resurrected by Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou
    Harris, whose 
    <i>Trio</i>recording topped the U.S. country singles charts.
    The song is in 6/8 time.</p>
      <p>In 1972, Jody Miller took a version to #18 on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>country charts.</p>
      <p>In 1987, Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt
    covered the song, including it on their 
    <i>Trio</i>album, and releasing it as the album's first single.
    Their version reached number one on the U.S. Hot Country Songs
    chart in May 1987.</p>
      <p>John Lennon recorded his own version of the song in 1973
    ("To Know Her Is to Love Her"), but it would not see release
    until the 1986 compilation 
    <i>Menlove Ave.</i>In 2007, Amy Winehouse recorded the song
    acoustically for a B-side of "You Know I'm No Good" for
    Napster. A version by Winehouse also appeared on the 2007
    compilation album, 
    <i>The Saturday Sessions: The Dermot O'Leary Show</i>. In the
    same year, the song was recorded as a duet by Jill Johnson and
    Lisa Miskovsky.</p>
