      <p>"Love Machine" is a 1976 number-one single recorded by
    Motown group The Miracles, taken from their album 
    <i>City of Angels</i>. This single was one of two Billboard Hot
    100 Top 40 hits recorded by The Miracles with Billy Griffin as
    lead vocalist; the other is 1973's "Do It Baby". Griffin had
    replaced Miracles founder Smokey Robinson as lead singer in
    1972. The song features a growling African warrior at some
    parts, as well as the wonderful guitar sounds of BB king.</p>
      <p>Engineered &amp; Mixed by Kevin Beamish, Love Machine was
    Produced by Freddie Perren,a former member of The Corporation
    brain trust in charge of the early Jackson 5 hits, "Love
    Machine" was written by Billy Griffin and his Miracles bandmate
    Pete Moore, who wrote the rest of 
    <i>City of Angels</i>as well. The song's lyrics, delivered over
    a disco beat, compare a lover to an electronic device such as a
    computer or a robot. The seven-minute song was split into two
    parts for its release as a single, with "Part 1" receiving most
    notoriety.</p>
      <p>"Love Machine" was a multi-million selling Platinum single,
    and a number-one hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and was the
    best-selling single of The Miracles' career .The single went to
    #5 on the Hot Soul Singles chart, and went to #20 on Record
    World's National Disco file Top 20 chart. It was also a Top 10
    hit in England, peaking at number three on the UK Singles
    Chart. By 1979, the song saw its first cover version, performed
    by Thelma Houston. Houston's version became a popular song with
    club DJ's at the time in the United States, although it did not
    chart. In Asia, and especially in Japan, "Love Machine" became
    Houston's most successful single, topping the Japanese charts.
    The success prompted her album 
    <i>Ride to the Rainbow</i>to be reissued as 
    <i>Love Machine</i>for the Japanese release.</p>

    1983 album,

    <i>Donnie Brasco</i>in 1997.</p>
