      <p>"Theme from (Do You Know Where You're Going To)" is a song
    written by Michael Masser and Gerald Goffin, and recorded by
    American singer Diana Ross as the theme to the 1975
    Motown/Paramount film 
    <i>Mahogany</i>(see 1975 in music). Produced by Masser, the
    song is a ballad that portrays its protagonist (Ross) as a poor
    African-American who becomes a successful Rome fashion
    designer, in keeping with the film the song was featured in.
    Remembering the happiness she had in the past, the song's
    character faces the reality of a loveless future and decisions
    that brought her to this point. The chorus, "Do you know where
    you're going to, do you like the things that life is showing
    you," exemplifies the song's theme of nostalgia and loss.</p>
      <p>Recorded with a full orchestral accompaniment, the "Theme
    from 
    <i>Mahogany</i>" became one of the most recognizable elements
    of the film 
    <i>Mahogany.</i>Many critics reviewed the film unfavorably, but
    generally praised the song. Later released as a single, "Theme
    from 
    <i>Mahogany</i>" became a number-one hit on the U.S. Billboard
    Hot 100, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Song.
    Ross performed the song live at the Academy Awards ceremony via
    satellite from the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>According to Diana Ross biographer J. Randy Taraborelli, "Do
    You Know Where You're Going To" had "been floating around
    Motown for years" and a version for Thelma Houston was being
    prepped for single release when it was decided to have Ross
    record the song to serve as the theme song for 
    <i>Mahogany</i>.</p>
      <p>Shirley Bassey covered the song on her 1995 album 
    <i>Sings the Movies</i>.</p>
      <p>In the late 1990s two Sony Music recording artists, Mariah
    Carey and Jennifer Lopez, both recorded covers of "Do You Know
    Where You're Going To" at the same time. The Mariah Carey
    version, co-produced by Carey and Stevie J and recorded in
    1998, was intended to be released as a single from her
    compilation album 
    <i>#1's</i>. During the same period, actress Jennifer Lopez
    signed to Sony and recorded the song for her debut album 
    <i>On the 6</i>. Executives at Sony decided that both versions
    would only be released as bonus tracks outside the U.S.
    Although Carey's version was later given a limited release,
    pressure for her to complete a new studio album interfered with
    the song's promotion, which was halted prematurely as a result.
    The song was then reissued in a remixed version as a
    promotional single for 
    <i>#1's</i>in 1999, and included on French editions of Carey's
    ninth album, 
    <i>Rainbow</i>. It did appear in the U.S., however, on the
    Wal-Mart-only EP 
    <i>Valentines</i>and on the Philippine version of 
    <i>#1's</i>. The same year, Lopez's version was issued only in
    the Netherlands and the Philippines as a bonus track for 
    <i>On the 6.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Dutch singer Patricia Paay recorded the song in 1995 for her
    movie song album, 
    <i>Time Of My Life</i>.</p>
      <p>Punk rock band Pinhead Gunpowder recorded a 2-minute version
    of the song, simply called "Mahogany", on 
    <i>Carry the Banner</i>.</p>
      <p>Da Band, a rap group put together by Sean Combs, covered the
    song, simply titled "Do You Know", on their debut album, 
    <i>Too Hot for TV</i>.</p>
      <p>The punk rock cover band Me First and the Gimme Gimmes
    covered the song on their 2008 album 
    <i>Have Another Ball!</i>, though it was simply called
    "Mahogany".</p>
      <p>Hong Kong singer Janice Vidal covered the song on her third
    studio album, 
    <i>Do U Know</i>in 2006.</p>
      <p>Australian singer Tina Arena recorded the song in 2007 for
    her sixth studio album, 
    <i>Songs of Love &amp; Loss</i>.</p>
      <p>European singer Lara Fabian recorded the song in 2009 for
    her new album, 
    <i>Every Women In Me</i>.</p>
      <p>The chorus of "Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're
    Going To)" is sung by Slick Rick at the end of his song
    "Teenage Love" from the album 
    <i>The Great Adventures of Slick Rick.</i>The single went to #8
    on the Billboard Hot Rap Singles Chart in 1988. The chorus is
    also used in the songs "Life" by Chubb Rock and "Do You Know"
    by Erick Sermon. In the episode "Rosebud" of the animated
    series 
    <i>The Simpsons</i>the chorus is played during a slide show of
    scenes from Mr. Burns' life. In an episode of 
    <i>Everybody Hates Chris</i>when Chris lies to his mother about
    having a good math grade she shows up at his math class and
    fearing his death his life flashes before his eyes and the song
    is played as this happens.</p>
