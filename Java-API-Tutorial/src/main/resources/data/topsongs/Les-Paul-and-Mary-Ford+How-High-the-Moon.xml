      <p>"How High the Moon" is a jazz standard with lyrics by Nancy
    Hamilton and music by Morgan Lewis. It was first featured in
    the 1940 Broadway revue 
    <i>Two for the Show</i>, where it was sung by Alfred Drake and
    Frances Comstock.</p>
      <p>In "Two for the Show", this was a rare (and unforgettable)
    serious moment in an otherwise humorous revue. The song was
    sung, in a slow fox trot tempo, by a group of evening-dressed
    people walking along a London street. At the end, they all
    looked at the sky, and cowered, obviously terrified: quick
    curtain. It was 1940, and the time of the London blitz: a clear
    night meant "bomber's moon".</p>
      <p>The earliest recorded hit version was by Benny Goodman &amp;
    His Orchestra. It was recorded February 7, 1940 and released by
    Columbia Records as catalog number 35391, with the flip side
    "Fable of the Rose". In 1948, bandleader Stan Kenton enjoyed
    some success with his version of the tune. The recording, with
    a vocal by June Christy, was released by Capitol Records as
    catalog number 911 (with the flip side "Willow, Weep for Me")
    and 15117(with the flip side "Interlude"). It reached the
    Billboard magazine Best Seller chart on July 9, 1948, its only
    week on the chart, at #27.</p>
      <p>The best-known recording of the song is by Les Paul and Mary
    Ford, made on January 4, 1951. The record was released by
    Capitol Records as catalog number 1451, with the flip side
    "Walkin' and Whistlin' Blues", and spent 25 weeks (beginning on
    March 23, 1951) on the Billboard chart, 9 weeks at #1. The
    record was subsequently re-released by Capitol as catalog
    number 1675, with "Josephine" on the B-side.</p>
      <p>The song was sung in various recordings by Ella Fitzgerald,
    becoming (with the Gershwin's "Oh, Lady Be Good!") Ella's
    signature tune. She first performed the song at Carnegie Hall
    on September 29, 1947. Her first recording, backed by the
    Daydreamers, was recorded December 20, 1947 and released by
    Decca Records as catalog number 24387, with the flip side "You
    Turned the Tables on Me". Her most celebrated recording of "How
    High the Moon" is on her 1960 album 
    <i>Ella in Berlin</i>, and her version was inducted into the
    Grammy Hall of Fame in 2002, which is a special Grammy award
    established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least
    twenty-five years old, and that have "qualitative or historical
    significance."</p>
      <p>Another jazz standard, "Ornithology" by Charlie Parker, is
    based on the chords of "How High the Moon". It was common among
    jazz musicians (Ella Fitzgerald, Lionel Hampton and others) to
    seamlessly include "Ornithology" in the solo when performing
    "How High the Moon". Miles Davis' "Solar" is also based on part
    of the chord structure.</p>
      <p>John Coltrane's composition "Satellite" is also based on the
    chords of "How High the Moon", which Coltrane embellished with
    the three-tonic progression he also used on his composition
    "Giant Steps".</p>
      <p>Paul McCartney stated during the filming of 
    <i>Les Paul: Chasing Sound</i>that "How High the Moon" was the
    first song The Beatles played in The Cavern Club.</p>
      <p>The sculptural armchair "How High The Moon", designed by
    Shiro Kuramata for Vitra AG of Switzerland in 1986, was named
    after this song.</p>
