      <p>"Shake You Down" is the title track from Gregory Abbott's
    debut album, released in 1986. As a single, it became Abbott's
    biggest hit and was certified platinum by the RIAA.</p>
      <p>Gregory Abbott wrote the song along with over thirty others
    before striking a record deal with CBS. He recorded a demo tape
    and chose the best three. Prior to achieving success on the
    charts he worked with Freda Payne.</p>
      <p>"Shake You Down" was released as the first single from 
    <i>Gregory Abbott</i>. It went to number one on the black
    singles chart in October 1986, and on January 17, 1987, it
    reached the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. It
    was a hit across the Atlantic Ocean, as well, peaking at number
    six in the UK Singles Chart (spending a total of 13 weeks on
    that chart from 22 November 1986). It was not intended as the
    original single to promote the album, as "I Got the Feeling"
    was scheduled to be the first single. It was postponed as the
    follow-up, peaking at #56.</p>
