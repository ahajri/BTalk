      <p>"Little Things Mean a Lot" is a popular song written by
    Edith Lindeman and Carl Stutz, published in 1953. Lindeman was
    the leisure editor of the 
    <i>Richmond Times-Despatch</i>and Stutz a disc jockey from
    Richmond, Virginia.</p>
      <p>The best known recording of the song, by Kitty Kallen,
    reached #1 on the U.S. Billboard chart in 1954 and also reached
    #1 on the Cash Box chart the same year. In addition the track
    climbed to the top spot in the UK Singles Chart in September
    that year.</p>
      <p>A cover of the song was done by Alma Cogan in the United
    Kingdom in the same year. Cogan's recording was released by HMV
    as catalog number HMV B 10717 and reached number 11 on the UK
    chart. The flip side was "Canoodlin' Rag". A remake by Joni
    James hit the U.S. Top 40 in 1960.</p>
      <p>Singer Joni James revived the song in 1960, a top 40 record.
    Another version of the song was done by country singer Margo
    Smith in 1978. The song peaked at #3 on the U.S. country chart
    that year, also appearing in Billboard's Easy Listening Top
    50.</p>
      <p>For Kallen her UK hit making days were over almost before
    they had begun. Without any further chart presence there, she
    became the first of the UK one-hit wonders.</p>
