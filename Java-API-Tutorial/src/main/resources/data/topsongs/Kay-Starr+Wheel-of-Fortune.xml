      <p>"Wheel of Fortune" is a popular song written by Bennie
    Benjamin and George David Weiss and published in 1951. It was
    orginally recorded in 1951 for Atlantic Records by the
    Cardinals. In one of the earliest examples of a major record
    label covering an independent black hit, Capitol recreated the
    Cardinals' arrangement for Kay Starr's hit version in 1952 .
    The song was also used as the theme to the television series of
    the same name.</p>
