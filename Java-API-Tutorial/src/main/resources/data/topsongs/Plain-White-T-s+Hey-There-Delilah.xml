      <p>"Hey There Delilah," written by Tom Higgenson, is the third
    single released from the band Plain White T's 2005 album 
    <i>All That We Needed</i>. In June 2007, over two years after
    the song's release, it became the band's first hit in the
    United States, eventually reaching #1 on the Billboard Hot 100
    in July. From July 3, 2007 through July 28, the song was the
    number one most played song on the radio, and the number one
    downloaded song on the U.S. iTunes Music Store. Since its
    release, "Hey There Delilah" has been covered by many artists
    worldwide in one form or another.</p>
      <p>It was the first number one single for the Plain White T's,
    and the second number one for the Hollywood label, after "The
    Way" by Fastball in 1998. It also reached number two in the UK.
    The song ended 2007 as the year's 14th biggest-selling single
    in the UK.</p>
      <p>Although "Hey There Delilah" is from the Plain White Ts'
    third album, 
    <i>All That We Needed</i>, since the single's popularity new
    versions of the intervening fourth album, 
    <i>Every Second Counts</i>, have "Hey There Delilah" added as a
    bonus track with a string section augmenting the original
    recording. The music video for the song was directed by Jay
    Martin.</p>
      <p>The song was written after Higgenson met Delilah
    DiCrescenzo, a nationally ranked American steeplechase and
    cross country runner.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Time</i>magazine named "Hey There Delilah" one of The 10
    Best Songs of 2007, ranking it at #7. Music critic Josh
    Tyrangiel called it "an intimate love song that's damn near
    universal." Tyrangiel praised the Plain White T’s for managing
    to make another "aching guy reaching out to distant girl song
    feel fresh," singling out singer Tom Higgenson’s otherwise
    imperfect voice and "nasal delivery [for making] the
    nearly-comic sincerity of the lyrics seem completely
    genuine."</p>
      <p>The song was a 2008 Grammy Award nominee for Song of the
    Year and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, but
    didn't win either award (Amy Winehouse and Maroon 5 won the
    awards).</p>
      <p>On VH1's Top 40 Videos of 2007, "Hey There Delilah" was #8,
    ahead of "If Everyone Cared" by Nickelback and behind "Say It
    Right" by Nelly Furtado.</p>
      <p>The song's sincere lyrics and simple structure have made it
    the target of numerous parodies.</p>
