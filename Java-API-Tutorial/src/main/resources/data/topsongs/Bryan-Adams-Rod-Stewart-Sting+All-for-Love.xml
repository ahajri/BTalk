      <p>"All for Love" is a rock song written by Bryan Adams, Robert
    John "Mutt" Lange and Michael Kamen for the soundtrack 
    <i>The Three Musketeers: Original Motion Picture
    Soundtrack</i>, performed by Adams, Rod Stewart and Sting. The
    song's musical-style and production were heavily inspired by
    rock and pop music from the 1980s, and its lyrics chronicle a
    relationship. The song was released as a CD single in the
    United States on November 16, 1993.</p>
      <p>The title was inspired by the Musketeers' motto: "All for
    one, and one for all".</p>
      <p>The single reached number one on the Hot 100 on January 22,
    1994, and remained there for three weeks.</p>
      <p>In December 2007, the Swedish trio E.M.D. released a cover
    of All for Love as their debut single. Debuting at number two
    in the official Swedish singles chart, it hit the top position
    the week after - eventually staying there for six consecutive
    weeks (the original version topped the chart for 10 weeks).</p>
      <p>The single stayed on the charts for 17 weeks, and was
    certified 3x Platinum in Sweden.</p>
