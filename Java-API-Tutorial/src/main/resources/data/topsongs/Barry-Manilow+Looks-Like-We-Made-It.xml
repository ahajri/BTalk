      <p>"Looks Like We Made It" is a song by American singer Barry
    Manilow, from his 1976 album, 
    <i>This One's For You</i>, composed by Richard Kerr with lyrics
    by Will Jennings. It was released as a single on 20 April
    1977.</p>
      <p>The song was first released in 1976 on his album 
    <i>This One's For You</i>, and it was released as a single in
    1977 where it reached the number one spot on both the U.S.
    Billboard Hot 100, and the U.S. Adult Contemporary chart.</p>
      <p>Despite the optimism suggested by the song's title, the
    narrator is actually ruminating on the fact that he and his
    ex-lover have finally found happiness and fulfillment—though
    not with each other. They have, indeed, "made it," but apart,
    not together. In 
    <i>The Billboard Book of Number One Adult Contemporary
    Hits</i>by Wesley Hyatt (p. 208), songwriter Will Jennings
    commented, "Richard [Kerr] and I have often remarked on the
    people, millions of them in the world, who misunderstood the
    lyric of 'Looks Like We Made It.' It is a rather sad and ironic
    lyric about making it apart and not together, and of course
    everyone thinks it is a full on, positive statement. I don't
    know. Perhaps it is... in a way."</p>
