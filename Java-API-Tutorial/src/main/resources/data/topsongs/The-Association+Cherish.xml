         <i>Cherish</i>is a pop music song written by Terry Kirkman and
    recorded by The Association. Released in 1966, the song reached
    number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in September of that
    year and remained in the top position for three weeks. In
    Canada the song also reached number one. Nina Simone recorded
    her version on 1967's 
    <i>Silk and Soul</i>.</p>
      <p>Session musician Doug Rhodes, also member of The Music
    Machine, played the Celesta on the recording.</p>
      <p>David Cassidy recorded his own version on his 1972 album 
    <i>Cherish</i>; his version of the song reached #9 on the Hot
    100 chart and spent one week at #1 on the adult contemporary
    chart (#3 in Canada). Barry Manilow covered this song, along
    with 
    <i>Windy</i>, on Manilow's 2006 album, 
    <i>The Greatest Songs of the Sixties</i>. Other covers have
    been performed by artists such as The Four Tops and Jodeci, but
    the original Association version of the song appears at the end
    of The Simpsons Season 20 Episode 6, entitled "Homer and Lisa
    Exchange Cross Words", and The Nanny Season 5 Episode 15,
    entitled "The Engagement". The chords for this song also appear
    in Spongebob Squarepants Season 5 Episode 13, entitled "Breath
    of Fresh Squidward".</p>
      <p>Known for its simple lyrics and complex vocal harmonies,
    "Cherish" is widely regarded as one of the greatest love songs
    ever written, and the original version still gets regular
    airplay today.</p>
