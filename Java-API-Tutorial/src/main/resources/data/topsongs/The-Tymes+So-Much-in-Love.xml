      <p>"So Much in Love" is a popular song sung by The Tymes that
    was a number-one song in the United States during the year
    1963. It was The Tymes first hit single. It topped the
    Billboard Hot 100 singles chart on August 3, 1963, and remained
    there for one week. The song was written by George William,
    Bill Jackson and arranged by Roy Strighis.</p>
      <p>The song has been covered several times since the original
    version was recorded. "So Much in Love" was sung by former

    <i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</i>released in 1982 and reached
    #59 on the Hot 100 as a single. A 1988 rendition by Art
    Garfunkel got to #11 on the Adult Contemporary chart, but the
    most successful remake of the song was by the R&amp;B vocal
    group All-4-One, who released "So Much in Love" in late 1993 as
    their debut single. The All-4-One version peaked at #5 on the
    Hot 100 in early 1994 and was certified Gold.Another group AFD
    (All Females Desired) did a remake of the song.</p>
