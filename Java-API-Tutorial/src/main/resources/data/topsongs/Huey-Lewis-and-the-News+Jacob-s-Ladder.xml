      <p>"Jacob's Ladder" is a 1986 song, written by Bruce Hornsby
    and his brother John Hornsby, that was recorded by Huey Lewis
    and the News and became a number-one hit on the Billboard Hot
    100 in 1987.</p>
      <p>Set in Birmingham, Alabama, the song marries the Biblical
    image of Jacob's Ladder to someone who rejects proselytizing
    evangelists, and is instead struggling to get through life one
    day at a time:</p>
      <p>The song was given by Hornsby to his friend Lewis, and it
    appeared on the group's September 1986 album 
    <i>Fore!</i>. It was the third single released from the album,
    and topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart for a week in March
    1987.</p>
      <p>A music video was filmed, of the band performing the song in
    a live concert.</p>
      <p>Bruce Hornsby later recorded his own rendition of the song,
    characteristically a little less pop, to appear on his 1988
    album, 
    <i>Scenes from the Southside</i>. It became part of his concert
    repertoire as well; a live bluegrass-influenced version (very
    different from the version on 
    <i>Scenes from the Southside</i>) appears on the 2006 album 
    <i>Intersections (1985â€“2005)</i>, which Hornsby performed with
    his brother John.</p>
