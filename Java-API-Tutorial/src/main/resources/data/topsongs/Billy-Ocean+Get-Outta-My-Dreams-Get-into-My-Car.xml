   <descr>
      <p>"Get Outta My Dreams, Get into My Car" is a number one
    single by singer Billy Ocean. Part of its popularity lay in its
    cutting-edge (for the time) video, which featured cartoon mixed
    with live-action sequences. The song went to number one on the
    U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and the Hot Black Singles chart. . It
    also peaked at three on the UK Singles Chart. The title was
    inspired by a line in the song "You're Sixteen", "you stepped
    out of my dreams, and into my car".</p>
