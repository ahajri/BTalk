      <p>The "Theme from " is a song with lyrics by Mack Discant and
    music by Max Steiner, written for the 1959 film, 
    <i>A Summer Place</i>, which starred Sandra Dee and Troy
    Donahue. It was recorded for the film by Hugo Winterhalter.</p>
      <p>Percy Faith recorded the most popular version of the tune,
    which spent an at-the-time record of nine consecutive weeks at
    number one on the still-young Hot 100 singles chart in early
    1960. It remains the longest-running number-one instrumental in
    the history of the chart. It reached number two in the UK. It
    hit number one in Italy under the title "Scandalo Al Sole".</p>
      <p>Faith won a Grammy Award for Record of the Year in 1961 for
    his recording. This was the first movie theme and the first
    instrumental to win a Record of the Year Grammy.</p>
      <p>Faith re-recorded the song twice – first, in 1969, as a
    female choral version, then, in 1976, as a disco version titled
    "Summer Place 76".</p>
      <p>In 2008, Faith's original version was ranked at number
    eighteen on 's top 100 songs during the first fifty years of
    the Hot 100 chart.</p>
      <p>The song was the title cut to Billy Vaughn's 1960 number-one
    album. The song was well-accepted by R&amp;B audiences of the
    day, reaching number two on the Billboard R&amp;B singles
    chart.</p>
      <p>"Theme from 
    <i>A Summer Place</i>" was also covered by Dick Roman, The
    Tornados (both in 1962), The Lettermen in 1965 (placing at
    number sixteen on the Billboard Hot 100) and The Ventures in
    1969.</p>
      <p>Andy Williams sang a deft, authoritative, and sublime
    rendition of "Theme from 
    <i>A Summer Place</i>" on his 1962 Gold-certified album 
    <i>Moon River</i>. A very impressive jazz version of the song
    was recorded by the legendary singer Julie London. It appeared
    on her album, 
    <i>Our Fair Lady</i>in 1965.</p>
      <p>American pop singer Eamon sampled "Theme from 
    <i>A Summer Place</i>" for his 2006 song "Elevator". The melody
    serves to illustrate the song's exploration of "elevator music"
    as an aphrodisiac.</p>
      <p>A version with lyrics was recorded by Bobby Vinton.</p>
