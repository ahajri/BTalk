      <p>"Bésame Mucho" is a Spanish language song written in 1940 by
    Mexican songwriter Consuelo Velázquez.</p>
      <p>According to Velázquez herself , she wrote this song even
    though she had never been kissed yet at the time, and kissing
    as she heard was considered a sin.</p>
      <p>She was inspired by the aria "Quejas, o la Maja y el
    Ruiseñor" from the Spanish 1916 opera 
    <i>Goyescas</i>by Enrique Granados.</p>
      <p>Bésame, bésame mucho,, Como si fuera esta noche la última
    vez., Bésame, bésame mucho,, Que tengo miedo a perderte,
    perderte después., , Quiero tenerte muy cerca,, Mirarme en tus
    ojos, verte junto a mí., Piensa que tal vez mañana, Yo ya
    estaré lejos, muy lejos de tí., , Bésame, bésame mucho,, Como
    si fuera esta noche la última vez., Bésame, bésame mucho,, Que
    tengo miedo a perderte, perderte después.</p>
      <p>Kiss me, kiss me a lot,, As if tonight was the last time.,
    Kiss me, kiss me a lot,, I fear to lose you, to lose you
    afterward., , I want to have you very close,, See myself in
    your eyes, see you next to me., Think that maybe tomorrow, I'll
    be far, far away from you., , Kiss me, kiss me a lot,, As if
    tonight was the last time., Kiss me, kiss me a lot,, I fear to
    lose you, to lose you afterward.</p>
      <p>Many interpretations use 
    <i>perderte otra vez</i>instead of the original 
    <i>perderte despues</i>.</p>
      <p>In a video from "TV Mexicana" from that time Consuelo
    Velázquez plays the piano herself and the singer sings 
    <i>perderte depues</i>.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Perderte despues</i>means "to lose you in the future".
    Considering Velázquez was 15 when she wrote the song, this
    sentence reflects less experience and an innocent feeling.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Perderte otra vez</i>means "to lose you again". This may
    have been modified to touch a more grown-up, experienced
    audience.</p>
      <p>The lyrics were translated into English by Sunny Skylar. The
    phrase "bésame mucho" can be translated into English as "kiss
    me a lot".</p>
      <p>"Bésame Mucho" is also known by translated names such as
    "Kiss Me Much", "Kiss Me a Lot", "Kiss Me Again and Again",
    "Embrasse-Moi", "Stale Ma Bozkavaj", "Suutele minua" and
    "Szeretlek én".</p>
      <p>Emilio Tuero was the first to record the song. It is
    believed by some sources to be the most recorded song of all
    time.</p>
      <p>The composition has been used on the soundtrack of numerous
    films including 
    <i>Great Expectations</i>, 
    <i>Let It Be</i>, 
    <i>A toda máquina</i>, 
    <i>Moon Over Parador</i>, 
    <i>Arizona Dream</i>, 
    <i>Moscow Does Not Believe In Tears</i>, 
    <i>The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear</i>, 
    <i>In Good Company</i>, 
    <i>Paid</i>, 
    <i>Juno</i>, 
    <i>Mona Lisa Smile</i>, 
    <i>Mivtza Savta, Ljubav i drugi zločini and Niravana by Gabriel
    Salvatores</i>.</p>
      <p>In 2007, Composer/Arranger and Jazz Trombonist Steve Wiest
    was nominated for a Grammy for Best Instrumental Arrangement
    for his version of "Besame Mucho" that was recorded by Maynard
    Ferguson on 
    <i>The One and Only Maynard Ferguson</i>.</p>
      <p>In Jan. 2010, at the 52nd Grammy Awards, Herb Alpert was
    nominated for Best Pop Instrumental Performance.</p>
