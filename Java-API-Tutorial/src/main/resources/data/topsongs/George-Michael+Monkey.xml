      <p>"Monkey" is a U.S. number-one hit song by George Michael. It
    was released as a single in 1988 and reached #1 on the U.S. Hot
    100 and #13 on the UK Singles Chart. "Monkey" debuted at #42 on
    July 9, 1988, reaching #1 for two weeks, beginning August 27,
    1988.</p>
      <p>"Monkey" became George Michael's eighth #1 U.S. single, and
    the fourth consecutive #1 from the 
    <i>Faith</i>album. George Michael joined Michael Jackson and
    Whitney Houston as three artists who all had four or more
    consecutive number one singles during the 1987-1988 era, from
    one album (Michael Jackson boasted an impressive five while
    Whitney Houston boasted seven consecutive).</p>
      <p>"Monkey" also reached number one in the U.S. Hot Dance Club
    Play chart for two weeks and became his first dance number
    one.</p>
      <p>When "Monkey" was released as a single, the single version
    was remixed by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly for a song that was such a hit, it has been
    omitted from most of George's greatest hits compilations,
    appearing only on the US/Canada version of 
    <i>Ladies &amp; Gentlemen: The Best of George Michael</i>.</p>
