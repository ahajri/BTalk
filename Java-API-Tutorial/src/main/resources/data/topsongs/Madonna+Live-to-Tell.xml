      <p>"Live to Tell" is a pop ballad by American singer-songwriter
    Madonna. Originally written by Patrick Leonard for the
    soundtrack of the film 
    <i>Fire with Fire</i>, the song was shown to Madonna, who
    decided to use it for then-husband Sean Penn's film 
    <i>At Close Range</i>. It was produced by Leonard and Madonna
    for her third studio album 
    <i>True Blue</i>, released in mid-1986, later appearing as a
    remix on the 1990 compilation album 
    <i>The Immaculate Collection</i>, in its original form on the
    1995 ballads compilation album 
    <i>Something to Remember</i>, and most recently on her third
    compilation album 
    <i>Celebration</i>(again in its original form), released in
    September 2009.</p>
      <p>The song includes instrumentation from guitars, keyboards,
    drums and a synthesizer, and its lyrics deals with deceit,
    mistrust and childhood scars. The music video, directed by
    James Foley, shows Madonna's first image makeover, featuring
    her with a cleaner look, shoulder-length wavy golden blond hair
    and subtle make-up.</p>
      <p>Released as the album's first single in March 1986, the song
    was a commercial success. It became Madonna's third number-one
    single on the Hot 100, and her first number-one on the Adult
    Contemporary chart. It was generally well-received by music
    critics, who frequently referred to it as the best ballad of
    her career. The song faced controversy when Madonna performed
    it on her 2006 Confessions Tour wearing a crown of thorns while
    hanging on a giant mirrored cross. The performance at Rome's
    Olympic Stadium was condemned as an act of hostility toward the
    Roman Catholic Church by religious leaders.</p>
      <p>"Live to Tell" was originally written by Patrick Leonard for
    the soundtrack of Paramount's romantic drama film 
    <i>Fire with Fire</i>, but after the company declined it,
    Leonard presented the song to Madonna. She decided to use it
    for 
    <i>At Close Range</i>, the new film of her then-husband, actor
    Sean Penn. Madonna made a demo of the song, which the film's
    director, James Foley, after hearing, asked Leonard to write
    the score for the film, as suggested by Madonna.</p>
      <p>Leonard initially envisioned a male voice interpreting the
    song, but decided to use Madonna's demo version as the main
    vocal with backup drums only, later recalling that "it was so
    innocent and so shy. It's as naive, as raw, as can be and
    that's part of what gave it all its charm." In a 1986
    interview, Madonna said that the mood on the song was inspired
    by a different facet of her image makeover and her desire to
    focus on something different.</p>
      <p>"Live to Tell" is a pop ballad, with background
    instrumentation from a keyboard, a synthesizer, a funk guitar
    and a mix of synthesized and real drumming. The song is written
    in the key of F major, is set in common time and moves at a
    moderate tempo of 112 beats per minute. The song starts with an
    instrumental introduction, performed by a synthesizer with the
    bass pedal set on D minor. Then the key suddenly changes to its
    relative major, F.</p>
      <p>Madonna's vocal range spans two octaves, from G
    <sub>3</sub>to G
    <sub>5</sub>. As she begins to sing the first verse, the bass
    pedal changes to C major, changes back to F during the chorus,
    and back to D minor during the chorus closure. This process is
    repeated during the second verse and chorus, which abruptly
    ends in a silence, with only the low and lifeless sound of the
    synthesizer, set in D minor. Madonna then start to sing the
    third verse—"If I ran away, I'd never have the
    strength"—between the tonal keys of D and F, closing with the
    repeating of the chorus until the song gradually fades out.</p>
      <p>Lyrically "Live to Tell" portrays the complexity of deceit
    and mistrust. The song is also about childhood scars and had an
    extreme emotional pitch. According to the book 
    <i>The Heart of Rock &amp; Soul</i>, the archetype of songs
    like "Live to Tell" is The Platters' song "The Great
    Pretender". In an interview about the song, Madonna said, "I
    thought about my relationship with my parents and the lying
    that went on. The song is about being strong, and questioning
    whether you can be that strong but ultimately surviving."</p>
      <p>"Live to Tell" was generally well-received by music critics.
    In a review of the album 
    <i>True Blue</i>, Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic called
    it a "tremendous ballad that rewrites the rules of adult
    contemporary crossover". Jim Farber from 
    <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>called the song "her best ballad to
    date". In a review of her compilation album 
    <i>The Immaculate Collection</i>, David Browne from the same
    magazine called it "one of her few successful shots at being a
    balladeer". 
    <i>Blender'</i>s Tony Power said that the song "is her
    [Madonna's] first ballad not sunk by her ordinary pipes".
    Alfred Soto from Stylus Magazine felt that "the song's set of
    lyrics remain her best" and that the vocals "seethes with a
    lifetime's worth of hurts which she nevertheless refuses to
    share". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine called the song
    "striking" adding that it "rewrote the rules of what a pop song
    was supposed to sound like".</p>
      <p>"Live to Tell" was released in the United States in March
    1986. It debuted on the Hot 100 at number forty-nine, reaching
    the top position eight weeks later, becoming Madonna's third
    number-one single in the U.S., and her second number-one that
    is featured in a film after "Crazy for You". The song was a
    crossover success, topping the Adult Contemporary chart for
    three weeks, and peaking at number three on the Hot Dance
    Singles Sales chart. In Canada the song debuted at the
    seventy-nine position of the 
    <i>RPM</i>singles chart in April 1986, reached the top for two
    weeks in May 1986, stayed on the chart for twenty-three weeks,
    and ended at the second position of the year-end chart.</p>
      <p>In the United Kingdom "Live to Tell" was released on April
    21, 1986. The next week the song debuted at number ten on the
    UK Singles Chart, peaked at number two, and stayed thirteen
    weeks on the chart. It was certified silver by the British
    Phonographic Industry (BPI) in May 1986. Across Europe, "Live
    to Tell" topped the Eurochart Hot 100 for two weeks, and the
    singles chart in Italy, as well as peaking inside the top ten
    in Belgium, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, and
    Switzerland.</p>
      <p>In 1986 Madonna starred in the film 
    <i>Shanghai Surprise</i>, where she toned down her appearance,
    inspired again by Marilyn Monroe. Madonna held the look for the
    "Live to Tell" video. In it her make-up was pale and subtle,
    her shoulder-length hair was wavy and golden blond, and her
    clothes consisted in a simple 1930s-style floral dress. In an
    interview with music critic Stephen Holden from 
    <i>The New York Times</i>, she commented about her new
    look:</p>
      <p>After a while I got sick of wearing tons of jewelry—I wanted
    to clean myself off. I see my new look as very innocent and
    feminine and unadorned. It makes me feel good. Growing up, I
    admired the kind of beautiful glamorous woman—from Brigitte
    Bardot to Grace Kelly—who doesn't seem to be around much
    anymore. I think it's time for that kind of glamor to come
    back.</p>
      <p>In addition to 
    <i>At Close Range</i>, Foley also directed the song's video.
    David Naylor and Sharon Oreck were in charge of the production.
    The video serves as a publicity campaign for the movie, as it
    includes brief scenes of the film that indicate the conflict
    the young man in the movie—played by Sean Penn—feels.</p>
      <p>The locations in the movie are separated visually from the
    shots of Madonna, who is singing in a darkened studio. Unlike
    her previous videos, Madonna portrays a narrator, whose song
    comments on the story, appearing in shots completely different
    from the narrative action. She appears to speak for the
    character, addressing his problems directly, like the chorus of
    a classical tragedy.,</p>
      <p>Madonna premiered the song at a benefit concert at Madison
    Square Garden to raise money for medical research for AIDS. She
    dedicated the song to the memory of her friend, artist Michael
    Burgoyne. Madonna has since performed the song on three of her
    world tours. In 1987, during the Who's That Girl Tour, she
    performed the song standing motionless in a single spotlight,
    wearing a black ensemble with tassels, golden tips and ribbing,
    designed by Marlene Stewart. Two different performances of the
    song on this tour can be found on the videos: 
    <i>Who's That Girl - Live in Japan</i>, filmed in Tokyo, Japan,
    on June 22, 1987, and 
    <i>Ciao, Italia! - Live from Italy</i>, filmed in Turin, Italy,
    on September 4, 1987. Three years later on her Blond Ambition
    World Tour, Madonna evoked Catholic images during the
    performance. She wore a black kaftan and a neon crucifix, while
    singing on a confession bench, with Roman columns and a
    platform full of votive candles in the background. Two
    different performances were taped and released on video, the 
    <i>Blond Ambition - Japan Tour 90</i>, taped in Yokohama,
    Japan, on April 27, 1990, and the 
    <i>Live! - Blond Ambition World Tour 90</i>, taped in Nice,
    France, on August 5, 1990.</p>
      <p>Madonna's performance of the song was the subject of
    controversy during the 2006 Confessions Tour. She was raised
    from the floor hanging on a mirrored cross wearing a red blouse
    and velvet pants, with a crown of thorns on her head. During
    the performance, the number 12,000,000 flashed above her on the
    stage's backdrop screens, along with images of African
    children. This was intended to detail the estimated number of
    children who have been orphaned by the AIDS pandemic in
    Africa.</p>
      <p>German prosecutors in Düsseldorf threatened to sue her for
    blasphemy, and Protestant bishop Margot Käßmann said that
    "maybe the only way an aging superstar can attract attention is
    to offend people's religious sentiments." The Russian Orthodox
    Church and the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia
    (FJCR) described Madonna's performance as amoral, and urged all
    members to boycott her upcoming concert in Moscow. The
    performance at Rome's Olympic Stadium—located near the
    Vatican—was condemned as an act of hostility toward the Roman
    Catholic Church by religious leaders. Italian cardinal Ersilio
    Tonini called the concert "a blasphemous challenge to the
    faith" and a "profanation of the cross", also calling for
    Madonna to be excommunicated. Reverend Manfredo Leone described
    it as "disrespectful, in bad taste and provocative".</p>
      <p>Muslim and Jewish leaders also criticized the performance.
    Mario Scialoja, the head of Italy's Muslim League commented "I
    think her idea is in the worst taste and she'd do better to go
    home." Riccardo Pacifici, the spokesman for Rome's Jewish
    community said "It's a disrespectful act, and to do it in Rome
    is even worse." Madonna released a statement about the
    controversy:</p>
      <p>I am very grateful that my show was so well received all
    over the world. But there seems to be many misinterpretations
    about my appearance on the cross and I wanted to explain it
    myself once and for all., There is a segment in my show where
    three of my dancers 'confess' or share harrowing experiences
    from their childhood that they ultimately overcame. My
    'confession' follows and takes place on a Crucifix that I
    ultimately come down from. This is not a mocking of the church.
    It is no different than a person wearing a Cross or 'Taking Up
    the Cross' as it says in the Bible. My performance is neither
    anti-Christian, sacrilegious or blasphemous. Rather, it is my
    plea to the audience to encourage mankind to help one another
    and to see the world as a unified whole. I believe in my heart
    that if Jesus were alive today he would be doing the same
    thing., My specific intent is to bring attention to the
    millions of children in Africa who are dying every day, and are
    living without care, without medicine and without hope. I am
    asking people to open their hearts and minds to get involved in
    whatever way they can. The song ends with a quote from the
    Bible's Book of Matthew: 'For I was hungry and you gave me
    food. I was naked and you gave me clothing. I was sick and you
    took care of me and God replied, "Whatever you did for the
    least of my brothers... you did it to me.', Please do not pass
    judgement without seeing my show.</p>
      <p>"Live to Tell" has been covered by numerous artists. In
    1992, American guitarist Bill Frisell covered the song in his
    fourth album, 
    <i>Have a Little Faith</i>. In 1998, Blonde Ambition released a
    dance single of the song featuring 6 different hi-NRG remix
    versions. Italian singer Lucrezia made an uptempo dance version
    of the song that was remixed by David Morales. It peaked at
    number two for two weeks on 
    <i>Billboard</i>
         <span style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s Hot Dance Club
    Play, and was included in the 2001 album 
    <i>Logic Pride, Vol. 4</i>. Canadian jazz singer Carol Welsman,
    covered it on her eponymous 2007 album.</p>
      <p>New Wave band Berlin covered the song for the 1999 album 
    <i>Virgin Voices: A Tribute to Madonna, Vol. 1</i>. In an
    interview with CNN, Berlin's lead vocalist Terri Nunn said that
    the tribute was necessary, commenting that "she [Madonna] has
    influenced a lot of people", adding that "Live to Tell" is the
    only song from Madonna that she would touch. Other covers of
    the song on tribute albums include Semi Moore on 
    <i>The Material Girl: A Tribute to Madonna</i>, released in
    2000, an instrumental version on the 2002 album 
    <i>The String Quartet Tribute to Madonna</i>, a folk version by
    Winter Flowerson on the 2007 album 
    <i>Through the Wilderness</i>, and a hi-NRG version by Melissa
    Totten on her 2008 album, 
    <i>Forever Madonna</i>.</p>
