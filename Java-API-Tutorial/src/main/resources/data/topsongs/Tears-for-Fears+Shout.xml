      <p>"Shout" is a song by the British band Tears for Fears.
    Written by Roland Orzabal and Ian Stanley and sung by Orzabal
    (with Curt Smith duetting on the chorus), it was the band's
    eighth single release (the second taken from their second LP 
    <i>Songs from the Big Chair</i>) and sixth UK Top 40 hit,
    peaking at #4 in January 1985. In the USA, it reached #1 on the
    Billboard Hot 100 on August 3, 1985 and remained there for
    three weeks. "Shout" would become one of the most successful
    pop songs of 1985, eventually reaching the Top Ten in 25
    countries.</p>
      <p>While Tears for Fears' previous single "Mothers Talk" had
    showcased a new, more extroverted songwriting style, "Shout"
    was a synth-rock anthem, complete with power chords, heavy
    percussion, a bass solo and female backing vocals. The song
    even features a lengthy guitar solo, something previously
    unheard of in Tears for Fears' music.</p>
      <p>We were halfway through recording 'Shout' when Roland had a
    birthday party. That evening I asked the four of them
    separately if they had any thoughts about sleeve notes for the
    record. Roland said "White text on black paper and say
    something about arguably the best offering yet." Curt said
    "You're probably the best person to make up some off the wall
    irrelevant drivel." Ian said "I don't like them, I'm not
    interested." Manny said "Did you know I used to play drums for
    'Rocky Ricketts and The Jet Pilots of Jive?"</p>
      <p>"Shout" is by far the most abundantly remixed song in the
    Tears for Fears catalog, with at least fifteen different
    versions of it having been officially released under the band's
    name.</p>
      <p>As was commonplace during the 1980s, the original 12" vinyl
    single release featured an extended remix of the song. Three
    remixes by collaborators Steve Thompson and Michael Barbiero
    later appeared on American releases of the single, including
    dub and a cappella versions. More recently, remixes have been
    done by notable DJs such as Jakatta, Fergie, Skylark and
    Beatchuggers. It was also remixed in the video game DJ Hero,
    where the song was mixed with Pjanoo.</p>
      <p>In addition to the twelve-inch mixes, "Shout" also appeared
    in three different 7" versions. The original single version
    released in the UK and much of the rest of the world clocks in
    at 5:53 and is the same mix of the song found on the 
    <i>Songs from the Big Chair</i>LP, albeit in an edited form.
    The version released in Germany and Japan is 4:51 in length and
    fades out during the guitar solo. Meanwhile, the final version
    released in America is specifically tailored for radio play at
    a concise 3:59 in length, featuring edits to the chorus and
    instrumental sections.</p>
      <p>In addition to the standard 7" and 12" releases, the "Shout"
    single was issued in two collectible formats in the UK: a
    limited edition 10" single and a 7" boxed pack featuring a 1985
    Tears for Fears calendar. A similar limited edition 7" pack was
    released in Canada, this one featuring a 12-page booklet of
    band photos. In 1988, "Shout" was reissued on the short-lived
    CD Video format. The disc included two mixes of the title
    track, a remix of "Everybody Wants to Rule the World", and the
    "Shout" music video.</p>
      <p>"The Big Chair" is an instrumental that served as the B-side
    to the "Shout" single. The only lyrics are dialogue samples
    from the movie 
    <i>Sybil</i>, from which the song (and the album 
    <i>Songs from the Big Chair</i>) takes its name. This is one of
    the few songs in the Tears for Fears catalogue on which
    founding member Curt Smith shares a writing credit. The song
    has since been included in the b-sides and rarities collection 
    <i>Saturnine Martial &amp; Lunatic</i>as well as the remastered
    and deluxe edition reissues of 
    <i>Songs from the Big Chair</i>.</p>
      <p>The promotional clip for "Shout", filmed in late 1984, was
    the second Tears for Fears clip directed by famed music video
    producer Nigel Dick. It features footage of Roland Orzabal and
    Curt Smith at Durdle Door in Dorset, England, as well as a
    studio jam with the full band (including Ian Stanley and Manny
    Elias) performing the song amidst a crowd of family and
    friends. The video reportedly cost only £14,000 to produce.
    Along with the clip for "Everybody Wants to Rule the World",
    the "Shout" video had a big hand in helping break Tears for
    Fears in America, due to its heavy airplay on music video
    pioneer MTV. Ironically, the band had at one time considered
    making a second video for the song's American single release,
    as the original was not considered MTV friendly.</p>
      <p>,</p>
      <p>"Shout" has been covered by the following artists:</p>
      <p>Joan Baez and the Neville Brothers performed the song during
    the Conspiracy of Hope tour to support Amnesty International in
    June 1986.</p>
      <p>Also in 1986, Weird Al Yankovic performed a polka version of
    the chorus in the track "Polka Party!" from the album of the
    same name.</p>
      <p>In addition, "Shout" was sampled by American gospel/hip hop
    artist Kirk Franklin in his song "Let It Go", from the album 
    <i>Hero</i>(2005). The song was also sampled for Girl Talk's
    remix of the Grizzly Bear song "Knife", along with the Clipse
    song "Wamp Wamp (What It Do)".</p>
      <p>The music video game 
    <i>DJ Hero</i>features "Shout" in a mashup with Eric Prydz's
    "Pjanoo" as a playable track.</p>
      <p>Was formerly the song played in the Mellon Arena when the
    Pittsburgh Penguins were scored against.</p>
      <p>In 2002, "Shout" was referenced in the title of a two-part
    episode of Canadian teen drama Degrassi: The Next Generation, a
    series known for naming many episodes after 1980s hit
    songs.</p>
      <p>In 2007, the song was featured in an episode of the USA
    Network television dramedy 
    <i>Psych</i>(titled "American Duos"), in which the two main
    characters perform it on stage in a spoof of American Idol.</p>
      <p>Sunday January 11, 2009-Cold Case Season 6 episode Breaking
    News closed out the airing with Shout.</p>
      <p>Former Milwaukee Brewers relief pitcher Brian Shouse would
    walk to the mound and warm up to the song Shout.</p>
