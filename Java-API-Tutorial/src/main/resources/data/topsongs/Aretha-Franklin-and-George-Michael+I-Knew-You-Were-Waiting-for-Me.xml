      <p>"I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)" was a song performed by
    Aretha Franklin and George Michael in a duet in 1987. It was
    written by Simon Climie and Dennis Morgan.</p>
      <p>The song was a one-off project that helped Michael achieve
    his ambition to sing with one of his favourite artists, and it
    reached number one in both the 
    <i>UK Singles Chart</i>and 
    <i>Billboard'</i>s Hot 100. The song was, remarkably,
    Franklin's first and only UK number-one hit, and only her
    fourth top ten achievement in the country since "I Say a Little
    Prayer", nearly two decades earlier. This was also the last of
    Franklin's eighteen Top 10 hits in the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot 100.</p>
      <p>For Michael, it became his third consecutive number-one in
    the UK since going solo, following 1984's "Careless Whisper"
    (though the single was actually from the Wham! album 
    <i>Make It Big</i>) and 1986's "A Different Corner". However,
    as the song was a duet, he was not afforded the same status or
    level of congratulation as Gerry &amp; The Pacemakers or
    Frankie Goes to Hollywood, the only two artists to have
    previously achieved number one with their first three releases.
    Michael's previous success (with Wham!, which included four
    number-ones) was also a factor in watering down the
    achievement.</p>
      <p>The single was the first Michael had recorded (as a lead
    artist) which he had not written himself. The co-writer, Simon
    Climie, was unknown at the time, although he later had success
    as a performer with Climie Fisher in 1988.</p>
      <p>The continuous run of UK chart-toppers ended for Michael
    thereafter, with his next number-one coming in 1991 - again as
    part of a duet (this time with Elton John) - while his next
    entirely solo number-one in the UK didn't appear until
    1996.</p>
      <p>On the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, "I Knew You Were Waiting (For
    Me)" debuted at #59, the week of February 21, 1987, reaching #1
    in its ninth week, April 18, 1987, and remaining there for two
    consecutive weeks.</p>
      <p>A live version of the song was featured on the Bucks Fizz
    album 
    <i>Live at Fairfield Halls</i>in 1991. A cover of "I Knew You
    Were Waiting (For Me)" was recorded in 2001 by Hear'Say as the
    B-side to their single "Everybody". Also Michael McDonald
    covered it in 2008 on his album 
    <i>Soul Speak</i>. Simon Climie had co-written the song and
    also produced it.</p>
