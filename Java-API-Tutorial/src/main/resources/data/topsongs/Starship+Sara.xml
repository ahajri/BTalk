      <p>"Sara" is a #1 hit song by the band Starship. It was sung by
    Mickey Thomas, of the newly renamed band Starship, from their
    first album 
    <i>Knee Deep in the Hoopla</i>. The song hit #1 on the
    Billboard Hot 100 chart on March 15, 1986 staying at that
    position for one week. It was the band's second #1 hit after
    the song "We Built This City" hit the mark a few months earlier
    in 1985. It also became the band's first number-one song on the
    adult contemporary chart, where it remained for three weeks.
    Although written by Peter and Ina Wolf, the song was named for
    Thomas's wife at the time, Sara (n√©e Kendrick).</p>
      <p>The music video for "Sara" prominently features actor
    Rebecca De Mornay and Thomas in a storyline about a
    relationship ending, with frequent flashbacks to what is
    presumably Thomas's character's childhood and the tornado that
    wrecked his home.</p>
