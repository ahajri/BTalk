      <p>"Disco Lady" is a 1976 single for Johnnie Taylor that went
    on to become his biggest hit. It spent four weeks at number one
    on the Hot 100 and six weeks on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>R&amp;B chart in the U.S. It was also the first
    single to be certified platinum by the RIAA. The single was
    Taylor's first for Columbia Records, where Taylor signed after
    his long-time label, Stax Records, went bankrupt. The song was
    produced by Taylor's longtime producer, Don Davis. Among the
    guests on the song were three members of Parliament-Funkadelic:
    bassist Bootsy Collins, keyboardist Bernie Worrell and
    guitarist Glen Goins, and Dawn's Telma Hopkins.</p>
      <p>"Disco Lady" is the first Hot 100 number-one hit to include
    the word "disco", though there had been several disco songs
    that had already reached number one.</p>
