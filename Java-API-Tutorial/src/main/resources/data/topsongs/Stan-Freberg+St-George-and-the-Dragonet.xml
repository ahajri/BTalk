      <p>"St. George and the Dragonet" is a short audio satire
    recorded August 26, 1953 by Stan Freberg for Capitol Records.
    It was released September 21, 1953 as a 45 rpm single (Capitol
    F2596).</p>
      <p>Scripted by Freberg and Daws Butler, the spoof combined the
    tale of "St. George and the Dragon" with the popular 1950s
    radio-TV series 
    <i>Dragnet</i>. The recording was a #1 hit, selling over one
    million copies in the first three weeks. The cast featured
    Freberg, Butler, June Foray and Hy Averback.</p>
      <p>Freberg wanted to use the original 
    <i>Dragnet</i>opening theme music by Walter Schumann. Capitol
    Records insisted he get the permission of 
    <i>Dragnet</i>star and creator, Jack Webb. Being a Freberg fan,
    Webb liked the idea, approved the use of the theme and allowed
    Freberg to use the same orchestra from the 
    <i>Dragnet</i>series with Schumann conducting. The recording
    had to be restarted several times because the trombone players
    were laughing so hard at the jokes that they were unable to
    play their instruments. Schumann's music was issued on sheet
    music with a front cover photograph of Freberg (minus his
    glasses), a humorous close-up with lighting as if it were a
    still from 
    <i>Dragnet</i>.</p>
      <p>"St. George and the Dragonet" was issued as a recording
    through the same channels as the distribution of popular songs,
    and for a time in 1953 it was #1 on both the 
    <i>Billboard</i>and 
    <i>Cash Box</i>record charts. The B side was another 
    <i>Dragnet</i>spoof, "Little Blue Riding Hood," based on the
    fairy tale "Little Red Riding Hood".</p>
      <p>Freberg and Butler would later issue a Christmas-themed 
    <i>Dragnet</i>parody, concerning a character named "Grudge" who
    was picked up by the squad for refusing to believe in Santa
    Claus.</p>
      <p>It was later made available in a 1991 CD set 
    <i>Dr. Demento 20th Anniversary Collection</i>(Rhino R2 70743,
    May 21, 1991); a 1998 CD 
    <i>The Very Best Of Stan Freberg</i>(Collectables COL-CD-2733;
    reissue of 1990 CD The Capitol Collector's Series); and a 1999
    CD set 
    <i>Tip Of The Freberg: The Stan Freberg Collection</i>1951-1998
    (Rhino R2 75645, August 3, 1999).</p>
