      <p>"Stuck on You" was Elvis Presley's first hit single after
    ending his two-year stint in the US Army. He recorded the song
    during March 1960, and the single was released within weeks and
    went to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in late-April
    1960, becoming his first number-one single of the 1960s, and
    thirteenth overall. "Stuck on You" also peaked at number six on
    the R&amp;B charts . The song knocked Percy Faith's "Theme from
    A Summer Place" which had spent nine weeks at number one on the
    chart.</p>
      <p>In New Zealand (and perhaps other countries), the single had
    a special paper sleeve with the usual RCA logo top left and 45
    R.P.M. bottom left and included, in large letters, "ELVIS" top
    right and bottom left: "Elvis' 1st new recording for his
    50,000,000 fans all over the world."</p>
