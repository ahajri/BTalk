      <p>"I'll Never Smile Again" is a popular song written by Ruth
    Lowe in 1939 and recorded and made famous by Tommy Dorsey and
    His Orchestra, with Frank Sinatra providing the vocal. It was
    the first ever #1 hit on the Billboard weekly Best Selling
    Singles chart by Tommy Dorsey and His Orchestra as Victor 26628
    in 1940.</p>
      <p>The best known version of the song is the 1940 recording by
    the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra featuring Frank Sinatra (Victor
    26628). This version stayed at no.1 for 12 weeks, from July 27
    to October 12, 1940, and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of
    Fame in 1982. Tommy Dorsey also recorded the song on V-Disc,
    V-Disc 582, also with Frank Sinatra on vocals. Glenn Miller and
    His Orchestra also recorded a version of the song in 1940.</p>
      <p>In 1965, Sinatra re-recorded the song for the double album 
    <i>A Man and His Music</i>, complete with faithful reproduction
    of the tinkling celeste and choral accompaniment which
    characterized the 1940 recording.</p>
      <p>It has been recorded by many other artists since, becoming a
    standard. The Platters brought the song back to the top 40 in
    1961.</p>
