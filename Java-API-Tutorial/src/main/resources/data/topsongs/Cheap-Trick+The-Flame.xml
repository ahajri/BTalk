      <p>"The Flame" is a hit power ballad by Cheap Trick, released
    on July 25, 1988. The song was first offered to English singer
    Elkie Brooks, who turned it down. Written by Bob Mitchell and
    Nick Graham, the song was initially released on Cheap Trick's 
    <i>Lap of Luxury</i>album. "The Flame" reached number one on
    the American Billboard Hot 100 in 1988 when issued as a single;
    it also reached number one in Australia. The success of the
    song brought the group out of a years-long commercial slump and
    back into music industry prominence.</p>
      <p>According to lead vocalist Robin Zander, "The band was very
    skeptical about performing this song live, because we only
    liked to perform songs written by us. However, a young man
    from, oh, I don't know, somewhere, confirmed to us after a show
    in Florida about a week after the song was released that the
    song was great and, get this, would be a #1 single. As we joked
    about the guy's prediction, we later realized whoa! This guy
    was right. I thank him for that."</p>
      <p>"The Flame" was covered in 1998 by electronic dance music
    singer Erin Hamilton. Included on her 1999 album 
    <i>One World</i>, the song was a top-twenty hit on the U.S. Hot
    Dance Club Play chart. Nine years later, the song was remixed
    and re-released as "The Flame 08" and this version went to
    number one on the U.S. dance chart, becoming Hamilton's first
    chart-topper.</p>
      <p>In 2004, "The Flame" was performed on the second season of 
    <i>Australian Idol</i>by eventual winner Casey Donovan on the
    Final 6 80's theme night. Donovan recorded the song as her
    cover song on the series cast album, 
    <i>Australian Idol Season 2 The Final 10 Cast Album</i>.</p>
