      <p>"Billy Don't Be A Hero" is a 1974 anti-war pop song by Paper
    Lace and was also recorded by Bo Donaldson and the Heywoods. It
    was written by Mitch Murray and Peter Callander.</p>
      <p>Because the song was released in 1974, it is often
    associated with the Vietnam War, though it may also refer to
    the American Civil War as evidenced by the "soldier blues" (the
    Union Forces) in the lyrics and on the cover of the single
    album. A young woman is distraught that her fianc√© chooses to
    leave the area with an Army contingent passing through the town
    and go with them to fight. She laments,</p>
      <p>The song goes on to describe how Billy is killed in action
    in a pitched battle after volunteering to ride out and seek
    reinforcements. In the end, the woman throws away the regret
    letter notifying her of Billy's "heroic" death.</p>
      <p>Paper Lace's version of "Billy Don't Be a Hero" hit number
    one on the UK singles chart on March 16 1974. The band made
    plans to release it in America but the song was covered and
    released by Bo Donaldson and the Heywoods. Their version was
    rushed out before Paper Lace could release and it hit no 1 on
    the Billboard Hot 100. on June 15. Subsequently although Paper
    Lace had the chart-topper in the UK, its version stalled at #96
    on the Billboard Hot 100. The Bo Donaldson version failed to
    chart at all in the UK.</p>
      <p>The song features in the film "The Adventures of Priscilla,
    Queen of the Desert" (1993).</p>
      <p>In the first episode of 
    <i>Friends</i>, Ross is asked about the last time he picked up
    a girl, and he says "Do the words 'Billy, Don't Be a Hero' mean
    anything to you?"</p>
      <p>Massive Attack's 1991 track "Blue Lines" (from the album of
    the same name) features the lyrics "take a walk, Billy, don't
    be a hero".</p>
      <p>In 
    <i>Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story</i>, the song is briefly
    heard during a montage in a disco cover by Dewey Cox (John C.
    Reilly) performing on rollerblades during "The Dewey Cox Show".
    A much longer cut of this scene can be seen in the director's
    cut, and the whole performance was included in the extras for
    the 2-Disc editions.</p>
      <p>In the Powerpuff Girls the leader of the Gang Green Gang
    says to another member, Billy, "Billy, don't be a hero!"</p>
      <p>In The Justice Friends (Cartoon Network, 1996) Mayor Glory
    says "Billy don't be a hero!" to William, Valhallen pet goat,
    when it jumps to save Krunk from the attack of Valhallen's
    living clothes.</p>
      <p>In an episode of ALF, Alf uses the line "Willie don't be a
    hero, don't be a fool with your life" referring to the head of
    the household, Wille Tanner, after Willie comes up with a bad
    idea.</p>
      <p>Dav Pilkey named the hero of 
    <i>The Adventures of Super Diaper Baby</i>Billy solely to make
    possible a passing homage to 
    <i>Billy Don't Be a Hero</i>.</p>
