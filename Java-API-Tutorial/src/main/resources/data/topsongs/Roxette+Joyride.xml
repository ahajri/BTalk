   <descr>
      <p>"Joyride", written by Per Gessle, was the first single
    released from Swedish pop duo Roxette's 1991 album 
    <i>Joyride</i>, the follow-up to the group's highly successful 
    <i>Look Sharp!</i>. The single topped the charts across Europe,
    and in Australia, Canada and the United States, where it spent
    one week at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, their last to
    do so, in May 1991. In the UK, "Joyride" peaked at #4.</p>
      <p>In interviews, Gessle states he got the idea for the opening
    line of this song from his girlfriend at the time who left a
    note on his piano that stated, "Hello, you fool, I love
    you."</p>
      <p>During the 1994 Stanley Cup playoffs this became the intro
    anthem to the Vancouver Canucks as they took the ice before
    each game.</p>
