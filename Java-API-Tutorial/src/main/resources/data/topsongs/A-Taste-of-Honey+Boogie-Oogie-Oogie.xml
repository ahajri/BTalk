      <p>"Boogie Oogie Oogie" is the name of a popular song by
    disco/R&amp;B group A Taste of Honey. Released from their
    self-titled album in 1978, it became an extremely popular
    "crossover" song. The lyrics urge listeners to "boogie oogie
    oogie till you just can't boogie no more." It topped the
    Billboard Hot 100 chart, the Hot Soul Singles chart, and the
    Hot Dance Club Play chart. It would eventually sell over two
    million copies and has become one of the most recognizable
    songs from the late 1970s disco era. It would also help the
    group win the Grammy Award for Best New Artist of 1978.</p>
      <p>In the late 1990s, the song was used in a national campaign
    ad for Burger King and was sampled by numerous rap acts. The
    song was also used in a campaign for Rold Gold Pretzels
    (featuring actor Jason Alexander) in the mid 1990s. Janice
    Marie Johnson, a member of the group, recorded another version
    of the song in 2001.</p>
      <p>G.Q. also released its own version of the song in 1979.</p>
