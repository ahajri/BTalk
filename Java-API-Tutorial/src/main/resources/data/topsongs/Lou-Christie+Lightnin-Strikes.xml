      <p>"Lightnin' Strikes" is a song written by Lou Christie and
    Twyla Herbert, and recorded by Christie on the MGM label. The
    song was arranged, conducted, and produced by Charles Calello
    and was recorded on September 3, 1965. The backup singers on
    the recording were Peggy Santiglia, Bernadette Carroll and
    Denise Ferri. It was a giant hit in 1966, making it to #1 on
    the Billboard Hot 100 chart in February and #11 on the UK 
    <i>Record Retailer</i>chart. RIAA certification on March 3,
    1966, garnering gold status for selling over one million
    copies. It was covered years later by the New York underground
    artist Klaus Nomi. Because of Christie's high pitched tone
    during the chorus, the song is often miscredited to Frankie
    Valli and The Four Seasons.</p>
      <p>On September 28, 1974, John Lennon was a guest of Dennis
    Elsas[1] on WNEW-FM, a New York City radio station, where he
    commented:</p>
      <p>"We're gonna play Electric Light Orchestra from last year,
    Showdown, which I thought was a great record... And for those
    people who like to know where licks and things come from, which
    I do.... this is a beautiful combination of I Heard It Through
    The Grapevine by Marvin Gaye and Lightning Strikes Again [by]
    Lou Christie, and it's a beautiful job with a little Walrus
    underneath."[2]</p>
