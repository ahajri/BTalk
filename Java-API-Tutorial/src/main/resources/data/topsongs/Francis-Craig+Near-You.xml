      <p>"Near You" is a popular song written by Francis Craig with
    lyrics by Kermit Goell. The song was published in 1947.</p>
      <p>The recording by Francis Craig (the song's composer) was
    released by Bullet Records as catalog number 1001. It first
    reached the Best Sellers chart on August 30, 1947, and lasted
    21 weeks on the chart, peaking at number one. On the "Most
    Played By Jockeys" chart, the song spent 17 consecutive weeks
    at number one, setting a record for both the song and the
    artist with most consecutive weeks in the number-one position
    on a music chart. In 2009, hip-hop group Black Eyed Peas
    surpassed Craig's record for artist with most consecutive weeks
    in the number-one position with the songs "Boom Boom Pow" and
    "I Gotta Feeling".</p>
