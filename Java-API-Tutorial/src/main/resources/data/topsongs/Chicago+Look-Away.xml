      <p>"Look Away" is the name of a song written by Diane Warren.
    It was recorded by the band Chicago for their 1988 album 
    <i>Chicago 19</i>, with Bill Champlin singing lead vocals. When
    released as a single that year, the song proved successful,
    topping the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks in December 1988,
    their last song to do so. The single also yielded the band's
    most successful year-end singles ranking, #1 on Billboard's
    1989 year-end Hot 100.</p>
      <p>The song was uncharacteristic of earlier Chicago hits in
    that it did not prominently feature horns. This song was also
    the band's first number one hit of the eighties that wasn't
    sung in a tenor voice. Some members of the band have stated
    when they would play the song live, the audience would just
    look confused because they were unfamiliar with the sound of
    Champlin's voice.</p>
