      <p>"The Joker" is a song by the Steve Miller Band from their
    1973 album 
    <i>The Joker</i>. The song is one of two Steve Miller Band
    songs that feature the neologism "pompatus". The song topped
    the US Hot 100 in early 1974.</p>
      <p>More than 16 years later, in September 1990, it reached
    number one in the UK Singles Chart for two weeks after being
    used in a Levi's television advertisement, thus holding the
    record for the longest gap between transatlantic chart-toppers.
    This reissue of "The Joker" also topped the Irish Singles
    Chart, the New Zealand RIANZ Singles Chart, the Dutch Nationale
    Top 100 and the Dutch Top 40.</p>
      <p>The song is sometimes misidentified by the title "Space
    Cowboy" because of the first line of the lyrics, which actually
    refer to an earlier song by that title from Miller's 
    <i>Brave New World</i>album. The following lines refer to two
    other earlier songs, "Gangster of Love" from 
    <i>Sailor</i>, and "Enter Maurice" from 
    <i>Recall the Beginning...A Journey from Eden</i>.</p>
      <p>During the song, Steve Miller thrice references lines from
    the 1954 The Clovers song "Lovey Dovey" when he sings "You're
    the cutest thing that I ever did see/ Really love your peaches,
    wanna shake your tree / Lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time
    <i>"; the second of these mentions is during the
    fade-out.</i>
      </p>
      <p>The song is also known for the wolf whistle performed on a
    slide guitar after the line "some people call me Maurrice
    [sic]" and the "Lovey Dovey" line.</p>
