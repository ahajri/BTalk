      <p>"Have You Never Been Mellow" is a popular song written by
    John Farrar and recorded by Olivia Newton-John as the title
    track for her album of the same name.</p>
      <p>In March 1975, the single became Newton-John's second
    consecutive number one hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100,
    although it stayed in the top chart position for just one week.
    The record also received a Grammy nomination for Best Female
    Pop Vocal Performance. The song also topped the Billboard Hot
    Adult Contemporary Singles chart and — in her continued success
    as a crossover artist — peaked at No. 3 on the Hot Country
    Singles chart.</p>
      <p>In the United States, it was Newton-John's fourth straight
    single to be certified gold for sales of one million copies.
    "Have You Never Been Mellow" also reached number one in Canada
    and peaked at number 10 in Australia and number 26 in Japan,
    but was not much of a success elsewhere in the world, failing
    to chart altogether in the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>The song is being performed as part of the 2007 Broadway
    musical 
    <i>Xanadu</i>.</p>
      <p>Along with her later single Xanadu, a remixed version by
    "The Olivia Project" appears in the Dance Dance Revolution
    series of video games.</p>
      <p>The Dutch band Party Animals sampled the song in 1996 on
    their hit "Have You Ever Been Mellow". The song reached number
    one on the Netherlands singles chart.</p>
      <p>The punk band the Feederz covered the song on their 1984
    debut album "Ever Feel Like Killing Your Boss?".</p>
