      <p>"Le Freak" is a 1978 hit disco song by Chic. It was the
    band's third single and first Billboard Hot 100 and soul
    number-one song. A 
    <i>New York Times</i>critic describes the song as a "haunting,
    minimalist pop-funk built around the guitar and bass". Along
    with the tracks, "I Want Your Love" and "Chic Cheer", "Le
    Freak" stayed at number one on the disco charts for seven
    weeks. The single bears the distinction of being the highest
    selling record ever on Atlantic Records, and the
    highest-selling single ever on WEA until it was displaced in
    1990 (by Madonna's "Vogue").</p>
      <p>The single achieved sales of over four million and also
    reached number seven in the UK singles chart.</p>
      <p>The song was ranked at number 19 on 
    <i>Billboard</i>Magazine's top 100 songs of the first 50 years
    of the Hot 100 chart.</p>
      <p>On the history of the song, guitarist Nile Rodgers later
    commented:</p>
      <p>"Le Freak" was the first song to be knocked out of (and
    return to) the number one position on the Billboard Hot 100
    three times. It first hit number one on the week ending
    December 9, 1978. After one week, it fell to number two,
    knocked out by the Barbra Streisand and Neil Diamond duet "You
    Don't Bring Me Flowers" (itself being a song "Le Freak" knocked
    out of the number one spot the previous week), and returned to
    the top position on December 23, 1978. After two additional
    weeks at number one, it again fell to number two, this time
    replaced by "Too Much Heaven" by the Bee Gees, and then
    reclaimed number one on January 20, 1979, where it remained for
    three additional weeks. This record remained in place till
    2008, when 
    <i>Bleeding Love</i>by Leona Lewis became the second track to
    hit number one three times. Later that same year rap artist
    T.I. tied this record twice with both "Whatever You Like" which
    he recorded by himself and "Live Your Life" which he recorded
    with Rihanna. On two of these occasions "Live Your Life"
    dethroned "Whatever You Like" from the Number One Position.</p>
      <p>The song is featured in the home edition of 
    <i>Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova 2 (North America)</i>.</p>
      <p>The song is featured in 
    <i>Leisure Suit Larry: Love for Sail!</i>during the fashion
    show portion of the game.</p>
      <p>"Le Freak" was performed on the television show 
    <i>Glee</i>on the episode "Showmance", much to the characters'
    chagrin.</p>
      <p>Most recently, "Le Freak" was covered by the electronica
    band Millionaires for the MTV movie 
    <i>Turn The Beat Around</i>.</p>
      <p>The song can be heard in the 2010 film 
    <i>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</i>in the Mother/Son Dance scene.</p>
