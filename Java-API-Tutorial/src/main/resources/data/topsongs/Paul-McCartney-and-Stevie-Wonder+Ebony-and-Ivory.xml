      <p>"Ebony and Ivory" is a 1982 number-one single by Paul
    McCartney, performed with Stevie Wonder. It was released on
    March 29 of that year. The song is featured on McCartney's
    album 
    <i>Tug of War</i>as well as several of Wonder's Greatest Hits
    albums. The song reached number one on both the UK and the US
    charts in 1982.</p>
      <p>At the simplest level, the song is about the ebony (black)
    and ivory (white) keys on a piano, but also deals with
    integration and racial harmony on a deeper level. The title was
    inspired by McCartney hearing Spike Milligan say "black notes,
    white notes, and you need to play the two to make harmony
    folks!". The figure is much older. It was popularized by James
    Aggrey in the 1920s, inspiring the title of the pan-African
    journal The Keys, but was in use from at least the 1840s.</p>
      <p>Although written by McCartney alone, the song was performed
    live in the studio by both McCartney and Wonder, though due to
    conflicting work schedules, both recorded their parts for the
    song's music video separately (as explained by McCartney in his
    commentary for 
    <i>The McCartney Years</i>3-dvd boxed set).</p>
      <p>"Ebony and Ivory" spent seven weeks at No. 1 on the Hot 100,
    and was the fourth-biggest hit of 1982. For McCartney, the
    song's run atop the chart was the longest of any of his
    post-Beatles works, and second longest career-wise (behind "Hey
    Jude" with The Beatles); for Wonder, it was his longest-running
    chart-topper. The song also spent five weeks atop the adult
    contemporary chart. It would also mark the first time that any
    single released by any member of the Beatles would hit the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Black Singles charts.</p>
      <p>Following the song's massive chart success, it was derided
    as "saccharine" and was later named as the tenth worst song of
    all time by 
    <i>Blender</i>magazine. On October 2007 it was named the worst
    duet in history by BBC 6 Music listeners. However, the song's
    title was picked up by a journalist reporting on two stroke
    victims, one black, one white, who played a duo, one hand
    each.</p>
      <p>The song listed at #59 on 
    <i>Billboard'</i>s Greatest Songs of all time.</p>
      <p>This song has been parodied in many US television shows,
    such as 
    <i>The Fresh Prince of Bel Air</i>, 
    <i>Everybody Hates Chris</i>and 
    <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, as well as movies such as 
    <i>Undercover Brother</i>and 
    <i>Guess Who</i>.</p>
