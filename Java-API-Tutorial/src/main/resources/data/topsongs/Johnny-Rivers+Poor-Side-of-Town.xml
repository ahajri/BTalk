      <p>"Poor Side of Town" is a song by Johnny Rivers, that reached
    number one on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot 100 and on the 
    <i>RPM</i>Canadian Chart on November 1966.</p>
      <p>It was a very important record for Johnny Rivers and
    represented a change of his initial music (characterized by a
    Go Go sound), that provided him with his early hits and
    acclaim. With "Poor Side of Town", Rivers moved into the
    pop-soul style.</p>
      <p>The melody is a soulful version of California-based pop,
    with some strong folk elements as well. Marty Paich provided
    the song's string arrangement.</p>
      <p>In his 2006 live album Eels with Strings: Live at Town Hall,
    Mark Oliver Everett (better known as Eels) recorded an acoustic
    version of the song backed by a mini orchestra.</p>
