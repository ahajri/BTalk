      <p>Smoke! Smoke! Smoke! (That Cigarette) is a Western swing
    novelty song written by Merle Travis and Tex Williams for Tex
    Williams and his talking blues style of singing. Merle Travis
    wrote the bulk of the song.. The original Tex Williams version
    went to number one for sixteen, non consecutive weeks on the
    Hot Country Songs chart . A popular version performed by Phil
    Harris stayed on the charts for 23 weeks, reaching #1 in July
    1947. On the Popular charts it became a number one hit in
    August 1947 and stayed at the top of the charts for six
    weeks.</p>
      <p>Williams made a stereophonic re-recording of the song for
    Capitol in 1960 on the LP album Smoke! Smoke! Smoke! .</p>
      <p>The song can be heard in the opening of the 2006 film 
    <i>Thank You for Smoking</i>. It has also been covered by Sammy
    Davis, Jr., Willie Nelson, Phil Harris, Jimmy Dean, Commander
    Cody, Asleep at the Wheel and a few others.</p>
      <p>The ostensible narrator of the song is himself a smoker and
    the song is primarily complaining about cigarettes being used
    to delay other activities. While the line "
    <i>And I don't reckon they hinder your health/I've smoked all
    my life and I ain't dead yet</i>" may lead some to believe the
    song suggests that cigarettes are perhaps not harmful to one's
    health, the guitar riff that follows indicates this line is
    intended as a joke -- The stanza "
    <i>Tell St. Peter at the Pearly Gate/That you hate to make him
    wait/But you just gotta have another cigarette</i>" and the
    chorus, which includes the line "
    <i>Puff, puff, puff and if you smoke yourself to death</i>"
    demonstrate that the song carries a warning about the adverse
    health effects of smoking. It also makes a statement as to the
    addictive nature of cigarette smoking.</p>
