      <p>"On Bended Knee" is a 1994 number-one hit single by Boyz II
    Men for the Motown label.</p>
      <p>Written and produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, the
    single is notable for having replaced the previous Boyz II Men
    single, "I'll Make Love to You", as the top song on the
    Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. This was the first time
    that an act had replaced itself at number one since the
    Beatles' heyday, when "I Want to Hold Your Hand", "She Loves
    You", and "Can't Buy Me Love" monopolized the top of the chart
    for a total of twelve weeks.</p>
      <p>The song also reached #1 on the Hot 100 Airplay and #2 on
    the Hot Singles Sales on December 3, 1994.</p>

      <p>The music video featured the band members and their break up
    and eventual reconciliation with four famous actresses: Kim
    Fields, Renée Jones, Lark Voorhies, and Victoria Rowell.</p>
