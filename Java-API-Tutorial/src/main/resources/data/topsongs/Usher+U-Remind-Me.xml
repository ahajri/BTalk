      <p>"U Remind Me" is a 2001 single from Usher's 2001 album 
    <i>8701</i>. It was the first US single from the album (as "Pop
    Ya Collar" was only included in some editions of 
    <i>8701</i>). The single topped the United States Billboard Hot
    100 Singles Chart on July 7, 2001 and reaching the top five in
    the United Kingdom and Australia.</p>
      <p>The song is about a man who meets a woman who seems like a
    nice catch, but he decides not to enter a relationship with her
    because she looks too much like an ex-girlfriend whom he had a
    bad breakup with. The video features Chilli of TLC.</p>
      <p>The song won Usher his first Grammy Award for Best Male
    R&amp;B Vocal Performance in 2002.</p>
      <p>There was a remix featuring Blu Cantrell and Method Man.</p>
