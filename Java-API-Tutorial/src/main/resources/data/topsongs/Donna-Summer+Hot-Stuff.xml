      <p>"Heaven Knows" (Brazil),</p>
      <p>"Hot Stuff" is a hit single released by American disco
    singer Donna Summer in 1979 as the first single release from
    her 
    <i>Bad Girls</i>album through Casablanca Records. Up to that
    point, Summer had mainly been associated with disco songs but
    this song also showed significant rock influences including the
    guitar, which had never been used in a Donna Summer single
    before. In fact the very intricate solo was played by Ex Doobie
    Brother and Steely Dan guitarist Jeff "Skunk" Baxter.</p>
      <p>"Hot Stuff" would also win Summer the Grammy Award for Best
    Female Rock Vocal Performance, making not only the first
    African-American artist to achieve that feat, but also the
    first woman to ever win a Grammy for Best Rock Vocal
    Performance. It is ranked #103 on the 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>magazine's list of "the 500 Greatest Songs
    of All Time". The songs also lists at #67 on 
    <i>Billboard's Greatest Songs of all time.</i>[1]</p>
      <p>The track was covered in 1995 by DJ Miko, giving the tune a
    contemporary dance music twist, and later partially covered by
    The Pussycat Dolls in their 2005 debut album 
    <i>PCD</i>. The verses (which were slightly altered) and the
    overall sound of the song are from Siobhan Fahey's "Bitter
    Pill", but with the chorus of Summer's "Hot Stuff" and it was
    renamed it "Hot Stuff (I Want You Back)". For the build up of
    the 1998 FA Cup final, Arsenal covered the song, using samples
    from the original, and replacing some lyrics, with descriptions
    of the squad, who were to play in the final. Still in 1998
    Mietta recorded an Italian language "Hot Stuff (Musica che
    scoppia)" for her album 
    <i>La mia anima</i>.</p>
      <p>The most recent artist to cover the song is EliZe, a Dutch
    popstar. Her version was released in September 2008 and is
    currently charting on various charts in Europe.</p>
      <p>Allison Iraheta sang this song on American Idol Season 8 on
    Disco Week.</p>
      <p>The song was memorably featured in the popular 1997 film 
    <i>The Full Monty</i>. During a press event on his 50th
    birthday, Charles, Prince of Wales helped recreate the scene in
    which the four main characters overhear the song while waiting
    in line at the unemployment office.</p>
      <p>The song is also featured prominently in an episode of the
    British mystery television series 
    <i>Jonathan Creek</i>in the episode Angel Hair where it is sung
    by Caroline Carver who plays popstar Sally Ellen Oakley. It
    also forms a part of the soundtrack of the movie 
    <i>Eurotrip</i>.</p>
      <p>Steve Allen did a "poetic" reading of "Hot Stuff" on one of
    his 1980 television shows, along the lines of his "poetic"
    readings of rock and roll songs he had done in the 1950s. At
    one point, Allen solemnly intoned, "Hot, hot, hot . . . stuff,
    stuff, stuff."</p>
      <p>In 1981, it was adapted to a TV commercial in Australia
    advertising the Four'N Twenty Pie.</p>
      <p>Professional Wrestler Hot Stuff Eddie Gilbert used it as his
    theme song throughout the years til his passing in 1995.</p>
      <p>The song appears on the video game 
    <i>Karaoke Revolution Volume 2</i>.</p>
      <p>"Hot Stuff" is the background song in Episode 31 of 
    <i>Sex and the City</i>in which Carrie Bradshaw is a guest
    celebrity judge on Staten Island for the New York City Fire
    Department's "Calendar Contest". "Bad Girls" is then played as
    the female characters dance afterwards.</p>
      <p>The song was performed by Roselyn Sánchez for the 2003 TV
    special 
    <i>The Disco Ball</i>.</p>
      <p>Hot stuff was certified Platinum by the RIAA and remained at
    number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for three
    non-consecutive weeks. The songs also lists at #67 on 
    <i>Billboard's Greatest Songs of all time.</i>[2] The song also
    topped the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart, with Summer's
    follow-up "Bad Girls" as a double A-side. The popular 12"
    single edition of the song plays the full 6:47 version of the
    song and then segues into "Bad Girls" 4:55 version.</p>
