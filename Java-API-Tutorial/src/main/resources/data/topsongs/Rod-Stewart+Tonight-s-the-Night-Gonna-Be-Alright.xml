      <p>"Tonight's the Night (Gonna Be Alright)" is a song written
    and recorded by Rod Stewart at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in
    Muscle Shoals, Alabama for his 1976 album 
    <i>A Night on the Town</i>. The song became his second US chart
    topper and charted well in other parts of the world as well.
    The song features whispers from Britt Ekland who was Stewart's
    girlfriend at the time.</p>
      <p>The song ranks at #14 on 
    <i>Billboard's All Time Top 100</i>. The song was the 61st
    video to be played on the debut of MTV on August 1, 1981.</p>
      <p>The singer is addressing a girl (later it states that she is
    a virgin) in which he demands she not do certain things, states
    some things he wants her to do, and tells her where she is to
    go and informs her of some of the things he wants to do with
    her. One particular line is a relatively blatant double
    entendre referring to sex:</p>
      <p>The song has been remade by such notable artists as Linda
    Clifford and Janet Jackson and sung by Anthony Kavanagh, Terry
    Steele, who reached number forty-four on the R&amp;B singles
    chart , and Alison Crawford on 
    <i>Grease is the Word</i>.</p>
      <p>In Jackson's cover, the lyrics imply that she and her
    partner are about to share a threesome with another woman.
    Indeed, Janet begins the song by saying, "This is just between
    me and you...and you." Additionally, each chorus addresses a
    different person, as she sings, "'Cause I love you, boy" in one
    and "'Cause I love you, girl" in another.</p>
