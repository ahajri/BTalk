      <p>"Sad Eyes" is a song written and recorded by Robert John,
    and released in 1979.</p>
      <p>Released in April 1979, "Sad Eyes" debuted May 19 on the Hot
    100. The song slowly inched its way up the chart throughout the
    late spring and summer, finally reaching the top of the chart
    on October 6 â€” nearly three weeks into the fall.</p>
      <p>"Sad Eyes" was one of the few non-disco number-one hits on
    the Hot 100 during 1979. During the first 10 months of the
    year, 13 of the year's 16 chart-toppers to the time when "Sad
    Eyes" reached the top were disco or had strong disco
    influences.</p>
