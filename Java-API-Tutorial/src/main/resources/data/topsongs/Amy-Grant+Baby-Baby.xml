      <p>"Baby Baby" is a 1991 single by Christian music and pop
    music singer Amy Grant. It was the theme song to the 
    <i>Heart In Motion</i>concept album, and was the first single
    derived from that album. The lyrics are the source of the
    album's title.</p>
      <p>The song is featured on the soundtrack to the 2005 film 
    <i>Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith</i>(albeit, a cover version). It it
    also featured in the 2004 film 
    <i>Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle</i>.</p>
      <p>"Baby Baby" was Amy Grant's biggest hit since her 1986 duet
    with Peter Cetera, "The Next Time I Fall." In the United
    States, "Baby Baby" was Grant's second number-one hit on the
    pop charts and her first as a solo artist, topping the
    Billboard Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary charts for two and
    three weeks, respectively. The single reached the Top Ten in
    seven countries, in addition to reaching #11 in Switzerland. In
    Britain, "Baby Baby" was the singer's first (and only) Top Five
    hit in that country, reaching #2. In the end, "Baby Baby"
    proved to be Grant's biggest hit and one of the most successful
    singles of 1991.</p>
