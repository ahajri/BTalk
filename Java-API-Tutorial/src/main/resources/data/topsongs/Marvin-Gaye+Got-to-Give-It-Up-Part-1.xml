      <p>"Got to Give It Up" is a 1977 hit single recorded by
    American soul music legend Marvin Gaye. The song held the
    number one position on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 for one week,
    from June 18, 1977 to June 25. It replaced "Dreams" by
    Fleetwood Mac, and was replaced by "Gonna Fly Now" by Bill
    Conti. On the R&amp;B Singles Charts it held the number one
    spot for five weeks on April 30, until June 17, 1977 (being
    interrupted twice at the number one position for one week by
    "Whodunit" by Tavares for the week of May 21, 1977 and Stevie
    Wonder's "Sir Duke" for the week of May 28, 1977 respectively).
    On the disco charts the single was also a number one hit. The
    song is currently #2999 on acclaimedmusic.net's "All Time Top
    3000 Songs".</p>
      <p>The song, solely written by Gaye and produced by Art
    Stewart, is about a man who was too shy to get on the floor and
    dance. But the groove allows him to lose himself in the music
    and dance, connecting with the people around him.</p>
      <p>Initially "Got to Give It Up" in its 11-minutes-plus version
    was included as the final side of his 1977 double-album live
    collection, 
    <i>Live at the London Palladium</i>(number three pop, number
    one R&amp;B). The song was issued as an edited four
    minutes-plus-release, titled "Got to Give It Up, Pt. 1" and
    became Gaye's biggest hit, with sales exceeding two million
    copies, since his seminal 1973 anthem, "Let's Get It On". The
    single reached number one simultaneously on Billboard's pop,
    R&amp;B and dance singles charts and continued the singer's
    embrace of disco music following the release of 1976's 
    <i>I Want You</i>. The song helped Gaye's live album, 
    <i>Live at the London Palladium</i>, which also featured the
    song in its full entirety, reach the top five of the albums
    chart and helped it become one of the best-selling albums of
    that year while "Got to Give It Up" was one of the best-selling
    singles of that year.</p>
      <p>The song became a precursor to the familiar percussion-led,
    falsetto-sung, party-fill atmosphere of Michael Jackson's 1979
    hit "Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough". The chant "Let's
    dance/let's shout/get funky what it's all about!", appearing in
    the latter part of the original track, was also appropriated
    for the chorus of The Jacksons' 1979 hit "Shake Your Body (Down
    to the Ground)".</p>
      <p>Corrected by Arthur (Art)Stewart August 26, 2009,AS I did
    not write the original version of this piece.</p>
      <p>"Got to Give It Up" was mostly sung by Gaye on both lead and
    background through the duration of the song especially in the
    second half. Marvin's brother, Frankie Gaye and Janis Hunter,
    who would become Gaye's second wife, provided background vocals
    near the end of the first half of the song.</p>
      <p>Aaliyah's cover version of Marvin Gaye's "Got to Give It Up"
    features a rap from Slick Rick, and was included on her 1996
    album 
    <i>One in a Million</i>. It was released as the second single
    in the UK. Aaliyah's version of "Got to Give It Up" failed to
    chart in the U.S. when it was commercially released there in
    December 1998 (It was not sent to radio stations for airplay,
    it was only made for sale in stores), but it was a minor hit in
    the UK peaking at number 37 in the UK Singles Chart. It reached
    number 34 in New Zealand. The single's B-side, "No Days Go By",
    was one of Aaliyah's few self-compositions. An alternate mix of
    Aaliyah's "Got to Give It Up" (without Slick Rick's vocals) was
    included on her posthumous 2002 compilation album 
    <i>I Care 4 U</i>.</p>
