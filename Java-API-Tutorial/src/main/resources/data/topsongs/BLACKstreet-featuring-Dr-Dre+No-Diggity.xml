      <p>"No Diggity" is a song by American R&amp;B group Blackstreet
    featuring Dr. Dre and Queen Pen. It reached #1 on the Billboard
    Hot 100 and #9 in the UK. It ranked at #91 on 
    <i>Rolling Stone and MTV: 100 Greatest Pop Songs</i>. It sold
    1.6 million copies in 1996, and won the 1998 Grammy Award for
    Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and was
    nominated for Best R&amp;B Song. It ranked at #32 on 
    <i>VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the '90s</i>.</p>
      <p>Between BLACKstreet's sung verses are rap verses performed
    by Dre, Teddy Riley and Queen Pen, in that order, as well as
    backing vocals from Shaquana Elam. Despite the fact that some
    of Dr. Dre &amp; Queen Pen's lyrics are censored, there are no
    "dirty" versions of the song.</p>
      <p>The song's hook is an altered sample from the beginning of
    "Grandma's Hands" by R&amp;B hitmaker Bill Withers.</p>
      <p>The official remix of the song is a cover to the pop artist
    Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean", it's later became a
    tribute.</p>
      <p>The video is directed by Hype Williams and features said
    artists in front of a beachhouse standing in the sand, dancers
    in a wet road surrounded by black limousines, and a marionette
    resembling former Nike spokesman Lil' Penny playing the piano
    sample in a club. It was nominated for Best R&amp;B Video and
    Best Rap Video on 1997's MTV Video Music Awards. Video
    production and casting was handled in house by Future Recording
    Studios manager Tony Brown who also worked closely with
    puppeteers to develop marionettes of Teddy Riley and Chauncey
    Black.</p>
      <p>On November 9, 1996, "No Diggity" overtook "Macarena" for
    the Billboard 100 Single's number one spot. Also, the term
    "I'll go Blackstreet on your ass", which is credited to
    Chauncey "Black as the street" Black began to appear in
    American slang as an expression of one's desire to "throw down"
    or initiate a confrontation.</p>
