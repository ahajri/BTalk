      <p>"Beat It" is a song written and performed by American
    recording artist Michael Jackson and co-produced by Quincy
    Jones for the singer's sixth solo album, 
    <i>Thriller</i>(1982). Eddie Van Halen was drafted to add the
    song's distinctive overdriven guitar solo. Following the
    successful chart performances of the 
    <i>Thriller</i>singles "The Girl Is Mine" and "Billie Jean",
    "Beat It" was released on February 14, 1983 as the album's
    third single. The song was promoted with a short film that
    featured Jackson bringing two gangs together through the power
    of dance.</p>
      <p>A commercial success, "Beat It" was awarded two Grammy
    Awards and two American Music Awards and was inducted into the
    Music Video Producers Hall of Fame. "Beat It" (along with the
    song's music video) propelled 
    <i>Thriller</i>into becoming the best-selling album of all
    time. The single was certified platinum in 1989. Rolling Stone
    magazine placed "Beat It" in the 337th spot on its list of The
    500 Greatest Songs of All Time.</p>
      <p>In the decades since its release, "Beat It" has been
    covered, parodied, and sampled by numerous artists including
    Fergie, Weird Al Yankovic, and Fall Out Boy. The song was also
    featured in the National Highway Safety Commission's anti-drunk
    driving campaign.</p>
      <p>"Beat It" was written by Michael Jackson for his 
    <i>Thriller</i>album. Co-producer Quincy Jones had wanted to
    include a rock 'n' roll song, though Jackson reportedly had
    never previously shown an interest in the genre. Jackson later
    said of "Beat It", "I wanted to write a song, the type of song
    that I would buy if I were to buy a rock song... That is how I
    approached it and I wanted the kids to really enjoy it—the
    school kids as well as the college kids." Upon hearing the
    first recorded vocals, Jones stated that it was exactly what he
    was looking for. Rock guitarist Eddie Van Halen, lead guitarist
    of hard rock band Van Halen, was then requested to add a guitar
    solo.</p>
      <p>When initially contacted by Jones, Van Halen thought he was
    receiving a prank call. Having established that the call was
    genuine, Van Halen recorded his guitar solo free of any charge.
    "I did it as a favor", the musician later said. "I was a
    complete fool, according to the rest of the band, our manager
    and everyone else. I was not used. I knew what I was doing - I
    don't do something unless I want to do it." Van Halen recorded
    his contribution following Jones and Jackson arriving at the
    guitarist's house with a "skeleton version" of the song. Fellow
    guitarist Steve Lukather recalled, "Initially, we rocked it out
    as Eddie had played a good solo—but Quincy thought it was too
    tough. So I had to reduce the distorted guitar sound and that
    is what was released." The song was among the last four
    completed for 
    <i>Thriller</i>; the others were "Human Nature", "P.Y.T.
    (Pretty Young Thing)" and "The Lady in My Life".</p>
      <p>On the record, right before Van Halen's guitar solo begins,
    a noise is heard that sounds like somebody knocking at a door.
    It is reported that the knock was a person walking into Van
    Halen's recording studio. Another story has claimed that the
    sound was simply the musician knocking on his own guitar. The
    lyrics of "Beat It" are about defeat and courage, and have been
    described as a "sad commentary on human nature". The line
    "don't be a macho man" is said to express Jackson's dislike of
    violence, whilst also referencing the childhood abuse he faced
    at the hands of his father Joseph. The song is played in the
    key of Eb minor at a moderately fast tempo of 132 beats per
    minute. In the song, Jackson's vocal range is B3 to D5.</p>
      <p>The uncredited guitarist who whipped out the fluttering,
    squealing solo on this ode to macho cowardice was Eddie Van
    Halen. The aerodynamic metal flight pumped crossover fuel that
    would boost the success of "Thriller" — a gimmick Jackson would
    flog later with spots from Slash and Carlos Santana. Without
    the Van Halen precedent, there might have been no collaboration
    of Run-DMC and Aerosmith on the 1986 rap/rock version of "Walk
    This Way".</p>
      <p>"Beat It" was released on February 14, 1983, following the
    successful chart performances of "The Girl Is Mine" and "Billie
    Jean". Frank Dileo, the vice president of Epic Records,
    convinced Jackson to release "Beat It" whilst "Billie Jean" was
    heading towards number one. Dileo, who would later become the
    singer's manager, predicted that both singles would remain in
    the Top 10 at the same time. "Billie Jean" remained atop the
    Hot 100 for seven weeks, before being toppled by "Come On
    Eileen". The Dexys Midnight Runners' song stayed at number one
    for a single week, before Jackson reclaimed the position with
    "Beat It".</p>
      <p>"Billie Jean" and "Beat It" occupied Top 5 positions at the
    same time, a feat matched by very few artists. The single
    remained at the top of the Hot 100 for a total of three weeks.
    The song also charted at number one on the US R&amp;B singles
    chart and number 14 on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Top Tracks chart in the US. "Beat It" also
    claimed the top spot in Spain and The Netherlands, reached
    number three in the UK, the Top 20 in Austria, Norway, Italy,
    Sweden and Switzerland, numbers 31 in Denmark and number 47 in
    France.</p>
      <p>In a 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>review, Christopher Connelly describes
    "Beat It" as the best song on 
    <i>Thriller</i>, adding that it "ain't no disco AOR track". He
    notes of the "nifty dance song", "Jackson's voice soars all
    over the melody, Eddie Van Halen checks in with a blistering
    guitar solo, you could build a convention center on the
    backbeat". Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine states that the
    song is both "tough" and "scared". Robert Christgau claimed
    that the song, in which Eddie Van Halen "wends his night in the
    service of antimacho", is the "triumph and the thriller". Slant
    Magazine observed that the song was an "uncharacteristic
    dalliance with the rock idiom". 
    <i>Stylus</i>expressed amazement that Van Halen performed a
    rock guitar solo on a R&amp;B record. The track also won praise
    from Jackson biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli, who stated that
    the song was "rambunctious".</p>
      <p>"Beat It" has been recognized with several awards. At the
    1984 Grammy Awards the song earned Jackson two of a record
    eight awards; Record of the Year and Best Rock Vocal
    Performance. The track won the Billboard Music Award for
    favorite dance/disco 12" LP in 1983. The single was certified
    gold, a few months after its release, for shipments of at least
    one million units. In 1989, the standard format single was
    re-certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of
    America, based on the revised sales level of one million units
    for platinum singles. The total number of digital sales in the
    US, as of March 2009, stands at 668,000.</p>
      <p>The short film for "Beat It", directed by Bob Giraldi and
    choreographed by Michael Peters, helped establish Jackson as an
    international pop icon. The film was Jackson's first treatment
    of black youth and the streets. Both "Beat It" and 
    <i>Thriller</i>are notable for their "mass choreography" of
    synchronized dancers, a Jackson trademark. The video included
    around 80 genuine gang members—to add authenticity to the
    production—and 18 professional dancers. Inspired by the
    Broadway musical 
    <i>West Side Story</i>, the video cost Jackson $150,000 to
    create after CBS refused to finance it. The video's featured
    choreography opened up many job opportunities for dancers in
    the US.</p>
      <p>The music video opens with the news of a fight circulating
    at a diner. This scene repeats itself at a pool hall, where
    gang members arrive via foot, forklift, and out of sewers. The
    camera cuts to a scene of Jackson lying on a bed, contemplating
    the senseless violence. The singer leaves the room upon hearing
    the commotion caused by the rival gangs. Donning a red leather
    J. Parks brand jacket, Jackson dances his way through the diner
    and pool hall, towards the fight. Arriving at the scene,where a
    knife fight is taking place between the two gang leaders, the
    singer breaks up the fight and launches into a dance routine.
    The video ends with the gang members joining him in the dance,
    agreeing that violence is not the solution to their
    problems.</p>
      <p>The video received recognition through numerous awards. The
    American Music Awards named the short film their Favorite
    Pop/Rock Video and their Favorite Soul Video. The Black Gold
    Awards honored Jackson with the Best Video Performance award.
    The 
    <i>Billboard</i>Video Awards recognised the video with 7
    awards; Best Overall Video Clip, Best Performance by a Male
    Artist, Best Use of Video to Enhance a Song, Best Use of Video
    to Enhance an Artist's Image, Best Choreography, Best Overall
    Video and Best Dance/Disco 12". The short film was ranked by 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>as the number one video, in both their
    critic's and reader's poll. The video was later inducted into
    the Music Video Producer's Hall of Fame.</p>
      <p>On July 4, 1984, Jackson performed "Beat It" live with his
    brothers during The Jacksons' Victory Tour. The brothers were
    joined on stage by Eddie Van Halen, who played the guitar in
    his solo spot. The song became a signature song of Jackson; the
    singer performed it on all of his world tours; Bad, Dangerous
    and HIStory. The October 1, 1992 Dangerous Tour performance of
    "Beat It" was included on the DVD of the singer's 
    <i>Michael Jackson: The Ultimate Collection</i>box set. The DVD
    was later repackaged as 
    <i>Live in Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour</i>. Jackson also
    performed the song on the 
    <i>Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special</i>, a concert
    celebrating the musician's thirtieth year as a solo performer.
    The performance featured Slash as the song's guest
    guitarist.</p>
      <p>A highlight of Jackson's solo concert tour performances of
    the song is that would he would begin the song on a
    cherrypicker, (in a similar fashion as he did with Earth Song
    during the HIStory Tour.) "Beat It" is a song, along with Wanna
    Be Startin' Somethin' and "Billie Jean", that Jackson had
    performed in all of his concert tours: Victory Tour, Bad World
    Tour, Dangerous World Tour, and the HIStory World Tour. The
    song also would've been performed on This Is It but the concert
    series was cancelled due to Jackson's sudden death.</p>
      <p>Visionary Single</p>
      <p>DVD Side:</p>
      <p>from the album 
    <i>Thriller 25</i>
      </p>
      <p>For 
    <i>Thriller 25</i>, Black Eyed Peas singer will.i.am remixed
    "Beat It". Entitled "Beat It 2008", the song featured
    additional vocals by will.i.am's fellow Black Eyed Peas member,
    Fergie. Upon its release in 2008, the song reached number 26 in
    Switzerland, the Top 50 in Sweden and number 65 in Austria.
    Following the reworking as 
    <i>Moby's Sub Mix</i>, released on the Jam single in 1992 (and
    rereleased as part of the Visionary campaign), this was the
    second remixed version of "Beat It" to get an official
    release.</p>
      <p>"Beat It 2008" received generally unfavorable reviews from
    music critics. Rob Sheffield of 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>claimed that the song was a "contender for
    the year's most pointless musical moment". About.com's Bill
    Lamb stated that Fergie's "sonically flattened" version of
    "Beat It" was "embarrassing". Allmusic criticized Fergie for
    "parroting the lyrics of 'Beat It' back to a recorded Jackson".
    
    <i>Blender'</i>s Kelefa Sanneh also noted that the Black Eyed
    Peas singer traded lines with Jackson. "Why?", she queried.
    Todd Gilchrist was thankful that the remix retained Eddie Van
    Halen's "incendiary guitar solo", but added that the song
    "holds the dubious honor of making Jackson seem masculine for
    once, and only in the context of Fergie's tough-by-way-of-
    <i>Kids Incorporated</i>interpretation of the tune". Tom Ewing
    of Pitchfork Media observed that Fergie's "nervous reverence is
    a waste of time".</p>
      <p>One of the earliest samples of "Beat It" was "Weird Al"
    Yankovic's 1984 parody song, "Eat It". Yankovic recorded the
    song with Jackson's permission. "The only reason he let me is
    that he has a sense of humour", Yankovic later said. "It is
    heartening to find somebody that popular, talented and
    powerful, who can really take a joke". He added, "Certainly
    there's a lot of major stars in the pop culture scene today,
    but people like Michael Jackson don't come around that often".
    The song won a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording and was
    certified gold in 1989. The song's music video mocked the "Beat
    It" short film scene-for-scene, with Yankovic mimicking
    Jackson's dance moves in a clumsy fashion. Jackson received
    royalties from Yankovic due to the strong similarities.</p>
      <p>A remix of "2 Bad", featured on Jackson's 
    <i>Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix</i>album,
    contains a sample of "Beat It" as well as a rap by John Forté
    and guitar solo by Wyclef Jean. Alvin and the Chipmunks
    performed the song during an episode of their TV series. In the
    episode, the Chipmunks and the Chipettes face off against
    bullies at an ice rink. Heavy metal band Metallica performed a
    minute cover the song at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2003 and
    again during the 2009 Sonisphere Festival. In 2004, Señor
    Coconut and His Orchestra released a Latin influenced cover of
    "Beat It". Italian metal band Raintime covered the song on
    their 2007 album Flies &amp; Lies.</p>
      <p>In early 2008 it was announced that pop punk band Fall Out
    Boy were to cover "Beat It" for their 
    <i>Live in Phoenix</i>album. The band had previously performed
    the song at venues such as Coors Amphitheatre and festivals
    such as the Carling Weekend in Leeds. Bassist Pete Wentz, who
    has claimed to have an obsession with Jackson, stated that
    prior to recording the song, he would only watch 
    <i>Moonwalker</i>. It was also announced that John Mayer was to
    add the guitar solo previously played by Eddie Van Halen.</p>
      <p>Patrick Stump stated that the band had not planned to cover
    the song. "Basically, I just started playing the riff in
    sound-check one day, and then we all started playing it, and
    then we started playing it live, and then we figured we'd
    record it and put it out with our live DVD." Pete Wentz added
    that the band had not originally intended for the song to be
    released as a single either. "'Beat It' seemed like a song that
    would be cool and that we could do our own take on", he said.
    Having spent time deciding on a guitarist for the song, Wentz
    eventually called John Mayer to add the guitar solo. "We were
    trying to think about who is a contemporary guitar guy who's
    going to go down as a legend", Wentz later noted.</p>
      <p>Upon its digital release as a single in April 2008, Fall Out
    Boy's cover of "Beat It" became a mainstay on iTunes' Top 10
    chart. The song charted at number 13 in Australia and 14 in New
    Zealand. The cover reached number 75 in Austria and peaked at
    98 in the Netherlands. 
    <i>The Times</i>claimed that the cover was "pointless".</p>
      <p>The music video for Fall Out Boy's "Beat It" was directed by
    Shane Drake, and was made in homage to Jackson. "I think when
    you're doing a Michael Jackson cover, there's this expectation
    that you're going to do one of his videos verbatim", Stump
    said. "What we decided to do was kind of inspired by Michael
    Jackson and the mythology of him. There are specific images
    that are reference points for us, but at any given point, it's
    not any of his videos. It's kind of all of his videos, all at
    once, but on a Fall Out Boy budget, so it's not quite as
    fancy". The costumes for the video were similar to the
    originals. "My costume is this take on one of the guys from
    Michael Jackson's original 'Beat It' video, like, the guy who
    plays the rival dancer", Wentz said during the filming of the
    video. The music video featured numerous cameos, including a
    karate class/dance session being taught by Tony Hale, and
    Donald Faison dressed up like Michael Jackson. The short film
    later received a MTV Video Music Award nomination for Best Rock
    Video.</p>
      <p>Michael Jackson's "Beat It" has been cited as one of the
    most successful, recognized, awarded and celebrated songs in
    the history of pop music; both the song and video had a large
    impact on pop culture. The song is said to be a "pioneer" in
    black rock music, and is considered one of the cornerstones of
    the 
    <i>Thriller</i>album. Eddie Van Halen has been praised for
    adding "the greatest guitar solo", aiding "Beat It" into
    becoming one of the biggest selling singles of all time.</p>
      <p>Shortly after its release, "Beat It" was included in the
    National Highway Safety Commission's anti-drunk driving
    campaign, "Drinking and Driving Can Kill a Friendship". The
    song was also included on the accompanying album. Jackson
    collected an award from President Ronald Reagan at the White
    House, in recognition for his support of the campaign. Reagan
    stated that Jackson was "proof of what a person can accomplish
    through a lifestyle free of alcohol or drug abuse. People young
    and old respect that. And if Americans follow his example, then
    we can face up to the problem of drinking and driving, and we
    can, in Michael's words, 'Beat It'."</p>
      <p>Frequently listed in greatest song polling lists, "Beat It"
    was ranked as the world's fourth favorite song in a 2005 poll
    conducted by Sony Ericsson. Over 700,000 people in 60 different
    countries cast their votes. Voters from the UK placed "Billie
    Jean" at number one, ahead of "Thriller", with a further five
    of the top ten being solo recordings by Jackson. Rolling Stone
    magazine placed "Beat It" in the 337th spot on its list of the
    500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The song was featured in the
    films 
    <i>Back to the Future II</i>, 
    <i>Zoolander</i>and 
    <i>Undercover Brother</i>. When re-released, as part of the 
    <i>Visionary</i>campaign in 2006, "Beat It" charted at number
    15 in the UK.</p>
