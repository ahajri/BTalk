      <p>"It's Gonna Be Me" is a song by 'N Sync, released as the
    second single from their 2000 album 
    <i>No Strings Attached</i>. The lyrics are addressed to a woman
    with apparent attachment issues, connected with bad experiences
    from previous relationships. The singer assures her that "I'm
    not like them", and that he's prepared to wait for her to
    overcome her problems. When she is ready to love someone again,
    he maintains, "It's gonna be me".</p>
      <p>The song was the only Billboard Hot 100 number-one hit for
    'N Sync. It topped the chart for 2 straight weeks.</p>
      <p>It has been certified Gold by the RIAA.</p>

      <p>Enhanced Video: "It's Gonna' Be Me" (Video) DVD Side:</p>
      <p>The music video was shot from April 27-28, 2000, and it was
    directed by Wayne Isham. It was released on MTV's "Making the
    Video", the music video for the song begins in a large toy
    store, with "Bye Bye Bye" playing in the background. Each group
    member is an animated plastic doll version of himself in a box
    similar to their album cover. They punch through the plastic
    front of their boxes and try to attract the attention of the
    girl shopping (Kim Smith) so they can be bought. Army men swing
    down, invade their boxes, and laugh at them when they are
    bought.</p>
      <p>Next, the boys spot a set of Barbie-like dolls and go hang
    out with them. The Barbies drop a net on them, and again tease
    them when they are bought and 'N Sync is not.</p>
      <p>Finally, the group gets back to their shelf and does a dance
    for the shopping girl. She buys them, and upon scanning, each
    doll becomes the real-life version.</p>
      <p>All of this is interspersed with the band in a color-lit
    room singing and dancing with the lights changing colors.</p>
      <p>Kim Smith also appears as the puppeteer in "Bye Bye
    Bye."</p>
      <p>After the success of the video, dolls like those portrayed
    by the band were created. They also had strings attached as a
    reference to the group's smash hit video "Bye Bye Bye".</p>
      <p>The video debut on TRL on May 23, 2000.</p>
