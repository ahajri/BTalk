      <p>"Make It with You" is a song written by David Gates and
    originally recorded by the pop/rock group, Bread, of which
    Gates was a member. The song first appeared on Bread's 1970
    album 
    <i>On the Waters</i>. Released as a single in June 1970, it
    would become the group's first top ten and only number-one
    single on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in the U.S.,
    spending the week of August 22, 1970, at the top spot. The
    single reached number five on the UK Singles Chart. It also was
    certified gold by the RIAA for sales of over one million
    copies. The song was well-received by easy-listening stations
    at the beginning of the singer-songwriter driven soft-rock era,
    reaching number four on the Billboard Easy Listening Top 40.
    Aretha Franklin, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Dusty Springfield, The
    Originals, The Main Ingredient, Teddy Pendergrass, Don Julian
    &amp; The Larks, Let Loose and Dennis Brown are amongst those
    who have recorded cover versions of the song.</p>
      <p>It has also been recorded in other languages including
    Spanish as 'Quiero Hacerte El Amor' with a version by Blvd
    featuring M C Blvd being popular on the West Coast. Ralfi Pagan
    reached number 32 on the Billboard R&amp;B chart during an
    eleven week run in the summer of 1971 with a Latin-soul version
    of the song.</p>
