      <p>"Penny Lane" is a song by The Beatles, written by Paul
    McCartney and credited to Lennon/McCartney. Recorded during the
    
    <i>Sgt. Pepper</i>sessions, "Penny Lane" was released in
    February 1967 as one side of a double A-sided single, along
    with "Strawberry Fields Forever". The song was later included
    on the 
    <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i>LP (1967). The single was the result
    of the record company wanting a new release after several
    months of no new Beatles releases. In 2004, 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>ranked the song at #449 on its list of the
    500 Greatest Songs of All Time.</p>
      <p>The song's title is derived from the name of a street in the
    band's hometown, Liverpool. The area that surrounds its
    junction with Smithdown Road is also commonly called Penny
    Lane. Locally the term "Penny Lane" was the name given to
    Allerton Road and Smithdown Road and its busy shopping area.
    Penny Lane is named after James Penny, an 18th century slave
    trader. McCartney and Lennon grew up in the area and they would
    meet at Penny Lane junction in the Mossley Hill area to catch a
    bus into the centre of the city. The street is an important
    landmark, sought out by most Beatles fans touring Liverpool. In
    the past, street signs saying "Penny Lane" were constant
    targets of tourist theft and had to be continually replaced.
    Eventually, city officials gave up and simply began painting
    the street name on the sides of buildings. This practice was
    stopped in 2007 and more theft-resistant "Penny Lane" street
    signs have since been installed though some are still stolen.
    The Abbey Road sign is also frequently stolen for the same
    reason.</p>
      <p>Beatles producer George Martin has stated he believes the
    pairing of "Penny Lane" with "Strawberry Fields Forever"
    resulted in probably the greatest single ever released by the
    group. Both songs were later released on the US 
    <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i>album in November 1967. In the UK,
    the pairing famously failed to reach #1 in the singles charts,
    stalling one place below Engelbert Humperdinck's "Release Me".
    In the US the song reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for a
    week before being knocked off by The Turtles song "Happy
    Together". The song features contrasting verse-chorus form and
    was credited "Lennon/McCartney", although McCartney was the
    main contributor to the song.</p>
      <p>Following the success of the double A-side "Yellow
    Submarine"/"Eleanor Rigby", Brian Epstein inquired if they had
    any new material available. Both songs, though recorded during
    the sessions for 
    <i>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i>, were left off the
    album, a decision Martin regretted, although the Beatles
    usually did not include songs released as singles on their
    British albums. This was also the first single by the Beatles
    to be sold with a picture sleeve in the UK, a practice rarely
    used there at that time, but common in the US and various other
    countries (such as Japan).</p>
      <p>Production began in Studio 2 at Abbey Road on 29 December
    1966 with piano as the main instrument. On 17 January 1967,
    trumpet player David Mason recorded the piccolo trumpet solo.
    The solo, inspired by a performance of Bach's 2nd Brandenburg
    Concerto, is in a mock-Baroque style for which the piccolo
    trumpet (a small instrument built about one octave higher than
    the standard instrument) is particularly suited, having a clean
    and clear sound which penetrates well through thicker midrange
    textures. Mason was paid 27 pounds and 10 shillings for his
    performance on the recording. Penny Lane production effects
    include percussion effects, piano through a Vox guitar
    amplifier with added reverb.</p>
      <p>The original US promo single mix of "Penny Lane" had an
    additional flourish of piccolo trumpet notes at the end of the
    song. This mix was quickly superseded by one without the last
    trumpet passage, but not before a handful of copies had been
    pressed and sent to radio stations. These recordings are among
    the rarest and most valuable Beatles collectibles. A stereo mix
    of the song with the additional trumpet added back in was
    included on the US 
    <i>Rarities</i>compilation in 1980, and is included on an
    alternate take of the song released on 
    <i>Anthology 2</i>in 1996.</p>
      <p>In August 1987, the piccolo trumpet Mason played on "Penny
    Lane" and two other Beatles tracks ("All You Need Is Love" and
    "Magical Mystery Tour") was sold in an auction at Sotheby's for
    $10,846.</p>
      <p>The verse and chorus in "Penny Lane" are in the keys of B
    major and A major, respectively.</p>
      <p>A feature of the song was the piccolo trumpet solo played by
    Mason. This is thought to be the first use of this instrument
    (a distinctive, speciality instrument, pitched about an octave
    higher than the standard B-flat trumpet) in pop music. Martin
    later wrote, "The result was unique, something which had never
    been done in rock music before." McCartney was dissatisfied
    with the initial attempts at the song's instrumental fill (one
    of which, featuring cors anglais, was released on 
    <i>Anthology 2</i>), and was inspired to use the instrument
    after seeing Mason's performance on a BBC television broadcast
    of the second Brandenburg Concerto by Johann Sebastian
    Bach.</p>
      <p>During the recording process, McCartney helped incorporate
    several incidental sound effects in keeping with the lyric,
    which can be heard on the final mix. These include a clanging
    bell in references to the fireman, a wispy flute depicting the
    children laughing, a splashy cymbal illustrating the rain, and
    a deep-seated bass string as the banker sits down in a
    chair.</p>
      <p>Lyrically there are several ambiguous and surreal images,
    which Ian MacDonald has interpreted as evidence of the song's
    hallucinogenic nature derived from McCartney's LSD intake. The
    song is narrated at the height of summer sun, despite the fact
    that it is simultaneously raining, and the clear blue skies
    appear in what seems to be November (as reference to poppies
    would be associated with Remembrance Day). MacDonald also notes
    LSD-induced perception in the fact that the nurse feels she is
    in a play - and is, anyway. Conflicting with MacDonald's
    interpretation, McCartney has repeatedly stated that he took
    LSD for the first time in March 1967, several months after the
    song was recorded.</p>
      <p>The 'shelter in the middle of the roundabout' refers to the
    old bus shelter, later developed into a cafe/restaurant with a
    Beatles theme, but now derelict and abandoned, despite its
    popularity as a tourist attraction. This is also Penny Lane Bus
    Terminus and is officially on Smithdown Place.</p>
      <p>The mysterious lyrics "Four of fish and finger pies" are
    British slang. "A four of fish" refers to fourpennyworth of
    fish and chips, while "finger pie" is sexual slang of the time,
    apparently referring to intimate fondlings between teenagers in
    the shelter, which was a familiar meeting place. The
    combination of "fish and finger" also puns on fish fingers. The
    lyrics as printed on the Blue (1967-1970) Album, however, are
    "Full of fish and finger pies" which are incorrect.</p>
      <p>Prior to securing international fame, Penny Lane's chief
    renown was as the terminus for several bus routes from the city
    centre and as the site, in the middle of the roundabout, of a
    handily located public convenience. The area remained largely
    unremarkable for the remainder of the 1960s and the 1970s; its
    most distinguishing feature was, perhaps, the regular arrival
    of tour buses from which tourists would alight, take a
    photograph or two, and then get back on the bus.</p>
      <p>Towards the end of the 1970s, businesses there included
    Penny Lane Records, Sven Books (Liverpool's first high-street
    sex shop), and a wine bar known in the early years as Harper's
    Bizarre, now called Penny Lane Wine Bar. In the mid-1980s, the
    bus shelter and public convenience were converted into a cafÃ©
    that marketed itself as Sgt. Pepper's. Following privatisation,
    the Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive bus depot,
    slightly up the hill past Bioletti's, was demolished and
    replaced with a shopping precinct complete with a supermarket
    and a public house.</p>
      <p>Since then, the general Penny Lane area has acquired a
    distinct trendiness and desirability. The "alternative"
    businesses (wholefood outlets, charity shops), the now expanded
    array of cafÃ©s, bars, bistros, and takeaway food emporiums, as
    well as handily located traditional businesses (Woolworths,
    WHSmiths and Clarke's cake shop) make the neighbourhood the
    most sought-after among Liverpool's large student population.
    Though the song refers to the "Penny Lane junction" on
    Smithdown Road, the street itself also leads down at the other
    end to the University of Liverpool's student halls of
    residence, near Sefton Park.</p>
      <p>In July 2006, a Liverpool Councillor proposed renaming
    certain streets because their names were linked to the slave
    trade. It was soon discovered that Penny Lane, named after
    James Penny, a wealthy 18th-century slave ship owner and strong
    opponent of abolitionism, was one of these streets. Ultimately,
    city officials decided to forego the name change and
    re-evaluate the entire renaming process.</p>
      <p>On 10 July 2006, it was revealed that Liverpool officials
    said they would modify the proposal to exclude Penny Lane.</p>
      <p>The fireman and fire engine referred to in the lyrics is
    based upon the fire station at Mather Avenue. This is some
    distance from Penny Lane. The station is still in use
    today.</p>
      <p>Universal Recording artist, Michael Barber, released a
    single to FM radio for his debut album on Universal Records,
    titled, "She's My Pennie Lane". Universal Records Leak</p>
      <p>The promotional film for the song was not filmed at Penny
    Lane â€” The Beatles were reluctant to travel to Liverpool.
    Street scenes of the Beatles were filmed in and around Angel
    Lane in London's East End. The outdoor scenes were filmed at
    Knole Park in Sevenoaks on 30 January 1967, where the
    promotional film for "Strawberry Fields Forever" was also shot.
    Both videos - directed by the Swede Peter Goldmann - were
    selected by New York's MoMA as some of the most influential
    music videos in the late 1960s. Film of Penny Lane was included
    - with some scenes of green Liverpool buses and a brief
    overhead view of the 'shelter in the middle of the roundabout',
    but none of the Beatles attended.</p>
