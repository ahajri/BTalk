      <p>"Doo Wop (That Thing)" is the first single from American Hip
    Hop-R&amp;B artist Lauryn Hill's debut album, 
    <i>The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill</i>.</p>
      <p>Hill's first solo singles were to 1997 movie soundtracks.
    The first of which was "The Sweetest Thing" for the Love Jones
    soundtrack, and the second; "Can't Take My Eyes Off You" which
    was a cover of Frankie Valli's 1967 song, for the film
    Conspiracy Theory.</p>
      <p>"Doo Wop" was released in Spring of 1998 as Lauryn Hill's
    first single from her debut album, 
    <i>The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill</i>. The song turned out to
    be a major success, becoming the 10th single to debut at
    number-one on the Billboard Hot 100. The song stayed there for
    two weeks in the fall of 1998, and won two Grammy Awards the
    following February. The successes of "Doo Wop" and the 
    <i>Miseducation</i>album established Hill as a success outside
    of her group, The Fugees.</p>
      <p>The music video for Doo Wop (That Thing) was filmed using a
    split screen technique. The video features Hill, who was six
    months pregnant at the time, performing "Doo Wop" at block
    parties in two different eras: the mid-1960s and the
    late-1990s. The video was directed by duo Big TV!. It was
    filmed in Washington Heights, Manhattan.</p>
      <p>"Doo Wop (That Thing)" is included as number 359 on the
    Songs of the Century list. At the Grammy Awards of 1999, the
    song won two awards: Best R&amp;B Song, and Best Female R&amp;B
    Vocal Performance. The song's music video won four 1999 MTV
    Video Music Awards for: Best Female Video, Best R&amp;B Video,
    Best Art Direction, and Video of the Year.</p>
      <p>Devendra Banhart has covered the song during live
    performances including Bonnaroo 2006, the Pitchfork Music
    Festival and Tim Festival 2006, in Brazil. Amy Winehouse has
    also incorporated the song into her own "He Can Only Hold Her"
    at live concerts in 2006, 2007 and 2008. Rihanna covered the
    song while on Kanye West's Glow in the Dark Tour in 2008. The
    American avant-rock band Mr. Bungle often performed an excerpt
    of the song as an outro for their song Travolta (Quote Unquote)
    during live shows in the mid- to late nineties, and up to their
    unofficial demise in 2002.</p>
      <p>The song charted on several charts in the U.S. upon
    release.</p>
