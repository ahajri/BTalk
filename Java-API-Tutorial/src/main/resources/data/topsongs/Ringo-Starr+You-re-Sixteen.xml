      <p>"You're Sixteen" is a song written by the Sherman Brothers
    (Robert B. Sherman &amp; Richard M. Sherman). It reached number
    eight in the United States in December 1960 by Rockabilly
    singer Johnny Burnette. In January 1974, a cover version by
    Ringo Starr hit number one. The latter performance reunited
    Ringo Starr with his former Beatles bandmate Paul McCartney.
    McCartney is credited on the album cover as having played the
    instrumental solo on a kazoo. Starr's version remains one of
    the few #1 singles to feature a kazoo solo. Harry Nilsson sang
    backing vocals.</p>
      <p>The original 1960 version of "You're Sixteen" by Johnny
    Burnette is featured prominently on the 1973 motion picture
    soundtrack of 
    <i>American Graffiti</i>.</p>
      <p>The video of this song features a pre-
    <i>Star Wars</i>Carrie Fisher as Ringo's love interest. At
    approx. 40 seconds into the video, a very "Princess
    Leia"-looking Fisher floats into Ringo's window.</p>
      <p>The song title has been the subject of musical parody by
    various performers, from Australian punk rock band Frenzal
    Rhomb's "She's Sixty, She's Beautiful And She's Mine" to
    Australian singer-songwriter Paul Kelly's "You're 39, You're
    Beautiful And You're Mine", a reference to "You're Sixteen" to
    Cold Chisel's EP entitled "You're Thirteen, You're Beautiful,
    and You're Mine". Wee Eck's " You're Sixteen Stone".</p>
