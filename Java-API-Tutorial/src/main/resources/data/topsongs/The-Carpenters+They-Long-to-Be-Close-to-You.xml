      <p>"(They Long to Be) Close to You" is a popular song written
    by Burt Bacharach and Hal David. It was first recorded by
    Richard Chamberlain and released as a single in 1963 as "They
    Long to Be Close to You," without parentheses. However, it was
    the single's flip side, "Blue Guitar," that became a hit.
    Although Richard Chamberlain recorded the first version, the
    tune was also recorded as a demo by Dionne Warwick in 1963 and
    re-recorded with a Burt Bacharach arrangement for her 1964
    album 
    <i>Make Way for Dionne Warwick</i>, and was released as the
    B-side of her 1965 single "Here I Am." Bacharach released his
    own version in 1968. But the version recorded by The Carpenters
    is the most well known, which became a big hit in 1970.</p>
      <p>In 1970, it was released by Karen and Richard Carpenter on
    their album 
    <i>Close to You</i>, and it became their breakthrough hit. The
    song stayed at number one on the Hot 100 for four weeks.
    Richard had stated that when Herb Alpert introduced the song to
    him back in early 1970, he was a bit apprehensive about the
    song, and didn't have confidence in it. He and Alpert
    collaborated on the song, and the finished product was a
    4-minute, 36-second long song. When A&amp;M Records decided to
    release it in May 1970, it became A&amp;M's biggest hit since
    Alpert's "This Guy's in Love with You" from 1968.</p>
      <p>With "(They Long to Be) Close to You," The Carpenters earned
    a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Performance by a Duo,
    Group or Chorus in 1971. It became the first of three Grammy
    Awards they would win during their careers.</p>
