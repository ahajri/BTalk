      <p>"Band on the Run" is the title song from Paul McCartney and
    Wings' acclaimed 
    <i>Band on the Run</i>album.</p>
      <p>It is composed of a three-part structure that revolves
    around the themes of escape and liberation. The song tells a
    story about a band being confined to prison and then escaping
    and going on the run.</p>
      <p>The first part (0:00-1:18) is soft and melodic. The singer
    complains about being stuck in one room forever alone, unable
    to see any nice people, like his mother.</p>
      <p>The second part (1:19-2:05) is more of a soft rock melody
    with the guitar, drums, and bass becoming more prominent. The
    singer thinks about giving everything away if he does escape.
    George Harrison unwittingly contributed the first line of this
    part: "If we ever get out of here" when he said it during one
    of the many Beatles' business meetings.</p>
      <p>The third and main part (2:05 to 5:09) is the initial rock
    part, which talks about the band escaping and going on the run.
    The people in the town are trying to find them forevermore, but
    they will never be found.</p>
      <p>The version played on the radio in America in 1974 was a
    shorter version of the song, edited down from the original 5:09
    to 3:50 in length. The difference was largely caused by the
    removal of the middle or the second part of the song, as well
    as the verse that starts with "Well, the undertaker drew a
    heavy sigh..."</p>
      <p>A cover version of "Band on the Run" was recorded in 2007 by
    Foo Fighters as their contribution to the 
    <i>Radio 1. Established 1967</i>album. This album,
    commemorating BBC Radio 1's 40th anniversary, features a cover
    version of a song released in each of the station's 40 years
    recorded by a modern-day band or solo artist, "Band on the Run"
    being the song selected to represent 1974.</p>
      <p>On 1 June 2008 McCartney was joined onstage by Foo Fighters
    lead singer Dave Grohl for a special performance in Liverpool.
    Grohl played guitar and sang backing vocals on "Band on the
    Run" and then played drums on Beatles songs "Back in the
    U.S.S.R." and "I Saw Her Standing There".</p>
      <p>The song was referenced by Will Ferrell during his act at
    The Concert For New York City. While impersonating George W.
    Bush, he told viewers of his attempt to come up with new names
    for the "talliband operation". He says Paul McCartney told him
    to name it "Talliband.. on the run."</p>
      <p>Tori Amos performed a snippet of this song at a number of
    shows during the Plugged '98 Tour.</p>
      <p>The jazz organ section from 1:33 - 1:48 is sampled on the
    track "Cutting Rhythms" by Tone Lōc on the album 
    <i>Lōc-ed After Dark.</i>
      </p>
      <p>The song features prominently on every McCartney/Wings
    best-of compilation and in McCartney's live shows. It was the
    second of six number-one singles for the band on the Billboard
    Hot 100. The song is featured on 
    <i>Guitar Hero World Tour</i>on the main setlist.</p>
