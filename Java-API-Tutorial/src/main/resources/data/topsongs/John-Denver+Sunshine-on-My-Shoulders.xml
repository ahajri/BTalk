      <p>"Sunshine on My Shoulders" is the title of a song recorded
    and co-written by American singer/songwriter John Denver. It
    was released as a single in 1973 and went to number one on the
    Billboard Hot 100 chart in the U.S. in early 1974.</p>
      <p>A television movie titled "Sunshine", shown on NBC in 1973,
    used the song as a theme. The movie starred Cliff DeYoung and
    Cristina Raines. It told the story of a young mother in love
    and dying. High ratings prompted a TV series (dubbed just 
    <i>Sunshine</i>) which ran for three months during the summer
    of 1974. The short-lived series began where the movie left off
    with the young widowed father (Cliff DeYoung) raising his
    stepdaughter (Elizabeth Cheshire).</p>
      <p>Denver described how he wrote "Sunshine on My Shoulders": "I
    wrote the song in Minnesota at the time I call 'late winter,
    early spring'. It was a dreary day, gray and slushy. The snow
    was melting and it was too cold to go outside and have fun, but
    God, you're ready for spring. You want to get outdoors again
    and you're waiting for that sun to shine, and you remember how
    sometimes just the sun itself can make you feel good. And in
    that very melancholy frame of mind I wrote "Sunshine On My
    Shoulders."</p>
      <p>It was originally the B-side of one of his earlier songs,
    "I'd Rather Be a Cowboy." As the Vietnam War came to an end,
    the song took on a new significance and began to receive
    airplay on adult contemporary radio stations. It entered the
    Billboard Hot 100 at number 90 on January 26, 1974 and moved
    into the number one spot nine weeks later, remaining at #1 for
    one week. The song also topped the adult contemporary chart for
    two weeks in 1974.</p>
      <p>The song inspired an illustrated children's book by
    Christopher Canyon.</p>
      <p>The song was covered by Canadian singer/songwriter Carly Rae
    Jepsen on her debut album.</p>
      <p>The song is briefly heard in a Raisin Bran commercial.</p>
