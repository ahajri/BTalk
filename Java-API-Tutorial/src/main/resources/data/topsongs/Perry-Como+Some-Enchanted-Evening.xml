      <p>"Some Enchanted Evening" is a show tune from the 1949
    Rodgers and Hammerstein musical 
    <i>South Pacific</i>.</p>
      <p>In the show, it is sung as a solo by Emile de Becque, the
    French plantation owner, who falls in love with the American
    navy nurse Nellie Forbush. In this song he sings of seizing the
    moment so that it won't slip away.</p>
      <p>In the film version, the song is sung by Giorgio Tozzi, who
    dubbed for Rossano Brazzi.</p>
      <p>According to the running commentary on the DVD release of
    South Pacific, this song provides an example of Hammerstein's
    use of verbs in a song. The DVD commentary mentions that Lehman
    Engel remembered how Oscar Hammerstein II wanted to write a
    song that used verbs, but waited ten years to do so before he
    wrote this song. The song is rich with verbs, such as "see",
    "hear" and "find."</p>
      <p>Besides recordings by Ezio Pinza (original cast album) and
    Perry Como (biggest hit version), several other versions were
    recorded; see below.</p>
