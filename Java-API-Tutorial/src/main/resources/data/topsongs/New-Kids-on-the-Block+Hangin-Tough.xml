      <p>"Hangin' Tough" is a 1989 single from New Kids on the Block.
    The fourth single from the group's second album of the same
    name, it peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles
    Chart on September 9, 1989. It also topped the UK singles chart
    and the song also became the first number one single of the
    1990s.</p>
      <p>There are two distinct versions of the song: The original
    album version which includes a keyboard solo and the remixed
    version, which is arguably more recognisable and commonly
    appears on Greatest Hits albums, which includes a guitar solo.
    The song was used in the 1989 film 
    <i>The Wizard.</i>

      <p>Joey McIntyre discusses "Hangin' Tough" - RetroRewind
    interview</p>
      <p>The New Kid's producer and writer Maurice Starr wrote this
    with the tough time the boy band had getting things off the
    ground in mind. He recalled in 1000 UK #1 Hits by Jon Kutner
    and Spencer Leigh: "We needed a song that symbolized what we
    had been through, so I came up with this title, Hangin'
    Tough."</p>
      <p>This flopped in the UK when it was first released and only
    reached the top after being re-released the following year in
    lieu of the success of "You Got It (The Right Stuff)".</p>
