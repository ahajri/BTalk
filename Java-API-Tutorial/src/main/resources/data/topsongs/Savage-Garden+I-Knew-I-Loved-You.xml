      <p>"I Knew I Loved You" is a single by Austrailian pop duo
    Savage Garden from their album 
    <i>Affirmation</i>. It was their second number one after "Truly
    Madly Deeply" and reached the top spot of Hot 100 on the week
    dated January 29, 2000, staying there for three consecutive
    weeks. After its third week at number one, the single was
    knocked off by Mariah Carey's "Thank God I Found You" featuring
    Joe and 98 Degrees and then returned to the top again the
    following week for its fourth and final week at the top. The
    song peaked at #10 in the UK Singles Chart in November
    1999.</p>
      <p>The music video was filmed with director Kevin Bray in
    August 1999 on a New York City Subway set that had previously
    been used for 
    <i>Seinfeld</i>.</p>
      <p>It features the band in a subway station with Hayes playing
    out a romantic plot on the subway with Kirsten Dunst as the
    object of his affections. The video shows the band alone in a
    carriage and also full of people. Then the train seems to stop
    and the power goes out, a red back up light comes on and
    everyone in the carriage joins hand. Hayes who is sitting
    opposite Dunst reaches out his hands to her. As they touch, we
    are shown the couple walking through a park bathed in sunlight,
    laughing and holding hands. Then it's back to reality as the
    train lights come back on and comes to the next station. Both
    Hayes and Dunst get up to leave, looking at each other as they
    exit the carriage and part ways. The video ends with Savage
    Garden performing by themselves in the carriage and subway.</p>
