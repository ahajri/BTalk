      <p>"When Doves Cry" is a song by the American musician Prince,
    and the lead single from his 1984 album 
    <i>Purple Rain</i>. It was a worldwide hit, and his first
    American number one single, topping charts for five weeks.
    According to 
    <i>Billboard</i>magazine, it was the top-selling single of the
    year.</p>
      <p>According to the 
    <i>Purple Rain</i>DVD, Prince was asked by the director to
    write a song to match the theme of a particular segment of the
    film - one which involved intermingled parental difficulties
    and a love affair. The next morning, Prince had reportedly
    composed two songs, one of which was "When Doves Cry".</p>
      <p>The song was #1 in the US for five weeks, from July 7, 1984
    to August 4, 1984. It kept the other big hit of that summer,
    Bruce Springsteen's "Dancing in the Dark", from reaching the
    top spot. "When Doves Cry" was voted as the best single of the
    year in 
    <i>The Village Voice</i>Pazz &amp; Jop critics' poll. 
    <i>Billboard</i>ranked it as the #1 single of 1984; however, on
    American Top 40 it was ranked as the number two song of the
    year as AT40 did not use 
    <i>Billboard'</i>s rankings that year.</p>
      <p>The B-side was the cult fan favorite "17 Days", which was
    originally intended for Apollonia 6's self-titled album. A
    12-inch single issued in the UK included the album track, "17
    Days", and two tracks from Prince's previous album, 
    <i>1999</i>, namely the title track and "D.M.S.R."</p>
      <p>Prince wrote and composed "When Doves Cry" after all the
    other tracks on 
    <i>Purple Rain</i>were complete. In addition to vocals, he
    played all instruments on the track. The song's texture is
    remarkably stark. There is no bass line, which is very unusual
    for a dance song; Prince has said that there originally was a
    bass line, but decided that the song was too conventional with
    it intact. During live performances of the song on the Purple
    Rain Tour, Brown Mark, Prince's then-bass player, added bass
    lines in this song and other songs without a bass line. The
    song features an intro of a guitar solo and drum machine,
    followed by a looped guttural vocal. After the lyrics, there is
    another, much longer guitar and a synthesizer solo. The song
    ends on a classical music-inspired keyboard piece backed by
    another synthesizer solo.</p>
      <p>"When Doves Cry" has gone on to become one of Prince's
    signature songs. 
    <i>Spin</i>magazine ranked the song 6th greatest single of all
    time. It was number #38 in Movement's list The Greatest Songs
    of All Time. 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>ranked "When Doves Cry" #52 on their list
    of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time (which makes it the
    second highest ranked song of the 1980s, after "The Message" by
    Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five). In 2006, VH1's "The
    100 Greatest Songs of the '80s" ranked the song #5 on the list.
    On October 13, 2008, the song was voted #2 on Australian VH1's
    Top 10 Number One Pop Songs countdown.</p>
      <p>The music video (directed by Prince himself) was released on
    MTV in June 1984. It opens with white doves emerging from
    double doors to reveal Prince in a bathtub. It also includes
    scenes from the 
    <i>Purple Rain</i>film interspersed with shots of the
    Revolution performing and dancing in a white room. The final
    portion of the video incorporates a mirrored frame of the left
    half of the picture, creating a doubling effect. The video was
    nominated for Best Choreography at 1985's MTV Video Music
    Awards. The video sparked controversy among network executives
    who thought that its sexual nature was too explicit for
    television.</p>
      <p>A hit cover version by R&amp;B singer Ginuwine was produced
    by Timbaland in 1996 for Ginuwine's 
    <i>The Bachelor</i>album, Ginuwine's cover uses actual dove
    sound effects as texture for its jungle music-inspired
    instrumental track.</p>
