      <p>"Get Busy" is a 2002 song by Jamaican dancehall reggae
    toaster Sean Paul, from his album 
    <i>Dutty Rock</i>. The dancehall-style song features a jumpy
    handclap riddim known as the Diwali Riddim. The lyrics
    encourage sexy ladies to get busy, dancing in a nightclub. Paul
    described it as "...mainly a party song. It's not all about
    smoking weed." "Get Busy" topped the Billboard Hot 100 for
    three weeks from May 10, 2003, preceded by "In Da Club" by 50
    Cent and followed by "21 Questions" by 50 Cent featuring Nate
    Dogg. It was performed live on 
    <i>Saturday Night Live</i>in May 2003. An official remix
    features Fatman Scoop and The Crooklyn Clan.</p>
      <p>The video for "Get Busy" (directed by Little X) was shot in
    Woodbridge, Ontario, a Vaughan suburb, and released in February
    2003. The video was also nominated for two MTV Video Music
    Awards for Best Dance Video and Best New Artist in 2003. At the
    end of the video Paul's brother Jason introduces a song, noting
    it as a brand new single, and Paul then sings part of "Like
    Glue". Kardinal Offishall makes a cameo appearance in the
    video.</p>
      <p>The song is currently being used to support Carl's Jr.
    milkshake ads, in which a man is shaking a cow to the song, and
    was also used in the 
    <i>DANCE! Online</i>, a multiplayer online casual rhythm game,
    and in the game Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2. Part of the
    song was played on 
    <i>Pico's Cousin 2</i>when Otis would smoke weed to boost his
    health. The song's remix was played in the club scene of the
    2003 film 
    <i>Grind</i>.</p>
