      <p>"Let's Get It On" is a song and hit single by soul musician
    Marvin Gaye, released June 15, 1973 on Motown-subsidiary label
    Tamla Records. The song was recorded on March 22, 1973 at
    Hitsville West in Los Angeles, California. The song features
    romantic and sexual lyricism and funk instrumentation by The
    Funk Brothers. The title track of Gaye's landmark 1973 album of
    the same name; it was written by Marvin Gaye and producer Ed
    Townsend. "Let's Get It On" became Gaye's most successful
    single for Motown and one of his most well-known songs. With
    the help of the song's sexually-explicit content, "Let's Get It
    On" helped give Gaye a reputation as a sex icon during its
    initial popularity.</p>
      <p>Co-written with doo-wop pioneer Ed Townsend, "Let's Get It
    On" was Gaye's plea for sexual liberation. When originally
    conceived by Townsend, who was released from a rehab facility
    for alcoholism, it was written with a religious theme. Gaye
    confidante Kenneth Stover changed some of the words around as a
    political song and Gaye recorded the version as it was written,
    but Townsend protested that the song wasn't a
    politically-conscious song but a song dedicated to love and
    sex. Gaye and Townsend then collaborated on new lyrics and
    using the original backing tracks as recorded, Gaye transformed
    the song into an emotional centerpiece. The album version of
    "Let's Get It On" features soulful and emotional singing by
    Gaye that is backed by multi-tracked background vocals, also
    provided by Gaye, along with the song's signature, and most
    notable, funky guitar arrangements. In an article for 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>magazine, music critic Jon Landau wrote of
    the song:</p>
      <p>The song was reprised on the fourth track of 
    <i>Let's Get It On</i>as "Keep Gettin' It On", which was a
    sequel and continuation of the original. The recording of the
    title track also inspired Gaye to revive previous recordings
    from his earlier 1970 sessions at the Hitsville U.S.A. Studio,
    which would consist of the rest of the album's material. During
    the time of the recording of the song and its subsequent album
    of the same name, Marvin had befriended the family of jazz
    guitarist Slim Gaillard and had become smitten with Gaillard's
    seventeen-year-old daughter, Janis Hunter. A widely reported
    story has been told that Hunter was in the studio when Gaye
    recorded the song at the recording booth. Gaye and Hunter were
    said to be smitten with each other and, within months, Gaye and
    Hunter began dating. Hunter would become Gaye's live-in lover
    by 1974. Their relationship would produce two children and a
    1977 marriage.</p>
      <p>"Let's Get It On" became one of Gaye's most successful
    singles, as it reached #1 on the Pop Singles chart on September
    8, 1973. The single remained at #1 for two weeks, while also
    remaining at the top of the Soul Singles chart for eight
    weeks.. In its first week at the top of the chart, "Let's Get
    It On" replaced "Brother Louie" by Stories, and was replaced by
    "Delta Dawn" by Helen Reddy; it later replaced "Delta Dawn" and
    was finally knocked off the top of the chart by Grand Funk
    Railroad's "We're an American Band". The single stayed inside
    the Billboard Hot 100 top-ten for thirteen weeks (ten weeks
    inside the top-five). The song became the biggest selling
    Motown release in the United States at the time, selling over
    two-million copies within the first six weeks of following its
    release. "Let's Get It On" also became the second best-selling
    single of 1973, only surpassed in sales by Tony Orlando &amp;
    Dawn's "Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree". At the
    time, the single was Motown's largest-selling recording ever,
    selling over three-million copies between 1973 and 1975. The
    single has gone on to sell over 1 million copies, and, on
    June 25, 2007, was certified platinum in sales by the RIAA.</p>
      <p>A bluegrass version of the song was later recorded by
    Shannon Lawson on his 2002 album 
    <i>Chase the Sun</i>. "Let's Get It On" was given a remix in
    2004, when producers mixed Gaye's vocals with a different
    musical production labeled as "stepper's music". Released in
    2005 as a single, "Let's Get it On (The Producers Mix)"
    returned the song to the Billboard R&amp;B charts, thirty years
    after its original release. The re-released version of "Let's
    Get It On" was certified as a gold single with sales in excess
    of 500,000 copies in 2005 by the RIAA, making it the
    best-selling Motown record ever released in North America. In
    2004, the song was ranked #167 on 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs
    of All Time. In 2008, "Let's Get It On" was ranked #32 on 
    <i>Billboard</i>magazine's 
    <i>Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs</i>list.</p>
