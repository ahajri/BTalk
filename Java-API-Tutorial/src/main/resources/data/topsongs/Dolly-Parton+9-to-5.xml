      <p>"9 to 5" is the title of a Grammy-winning, number-one song
    written and originally performed by Dolly Parton for the 1980
    film comedy 
    <i>Nine to Five</i>, starring Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, and
    Parton in her film debut.</p>
      <p>The film's title song garnered Parton an Academy Award
    nomination and four Grammy Award nominations, winning her the
    awards for "Best Country Song" and "Best Country Vocal
    Performance, Female". In addition to appearing on the film
    soundtrack, the song was the centerpiece of Parton's 
    <i>9 to 5 and Odd Jobs</i>album, released in late 1980. The
    song was released as a single in November 1980 and reached
    number one on both the Billboard Country Chart and the
    Billboard Hot 100 in January and February of 1981,
    respectively. For a time, the song became something of an
    anthem for office workers in the U.S., and as recently as 2004
    Parton's song ranked number seventy-eight on American Film
    Institute's "100 years, 100 songs".</p>
      <p>The song—and film—owe their titles to an organization
    founded in 1973 with the aim of bringing about better treatment
    for women in the workplace.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Sesame Street</i>made an educational parody of the song
    performed by the Anything Muppet parody of Parton herself,
    Polly Darton, called "Counting 1 to 5".</p>
      <p>The song is one of the rare Billboard hits with the
    endurance to hit number one, be replaced by another song at the
    top spot (Eddie Rabbitt's "I Love A Rainy Night"), and then
    return to the number one position three weeks later. It is also
    one of the few Billboard chart songs to feature the clacking of
    a typewriter. Parton has stated in a number of interviews
    through the years that when she wrote the song, she devised the
    clacking typewriter rhythm running her acrylic fingernails back
    and forth against one another. [1]</p>
      <p>The song is featured in a musical theater adaptation of the
    film, featuring a book by the film's original writer, Patricia
    Resnick, and 20 additional songs written by Dolly Parton. 
    <i>9 to 5</i>began previews in Los Angeles on September 9,
    2008, and is slated to move to Broadway for the 2009 season,
    with previews scheduled to begin at New York City's Marquis
    Theatre on March 24, 2009.</p>
      <p>A few months after Parton's song and the film, Scottish
    singer Sheena Easton released a single called "9 To 5"
    throughout much of the world. The Easton song was renamed
    "Morning Train (Nine to Five)" to avoid confusion. Easton's
    single reached the number one spot on Billboards Hot 100 Chart
    three months after Parton's song left that spot. While Parton's
    song features an empowered (if challenged) working woman,
    Easton's song features a passive, love-struck woman waiting
    around at home all day for her lover to return to her.</p>
      <p>In 1981, Kikki Danielsson covered the song on her album 
    <i>Just Like a Woman</i>, and the song remains one of her most
    famous country music recordings. The song was also covered by
    Swedish punk band Millencolin and included in their 1999
    compilation album The Melancholy Collection, a collection of
    b-sides and rarities. Mark Wilson also sang "9 to 5" on 
    <i>It Takes Two</i>with Rachael Beck. "9 to 5" was performed
    with sitar accompaniment in the opening scenes of the 2008 film
    
    <i>The Love Guru</i>, sung by the titular character played by
    Mike Myers; this version appears on the film's soundtrack
    album.</p>
      <p>Although the Parton recording only reached #47 in the UK, it
    remains a popular song on radio and in nightclubs through
    Britain and was spliced between "Independent Women Part 1" by
    Destiny's Child and "Eple" by Royksopp for the Soulwax album 
    <i>As Heard On Radio Soulwax Part 2</i>.</p>
      <p>The song appears on the game 
    <i>Karaoke Revolution Country</i>.</p>
