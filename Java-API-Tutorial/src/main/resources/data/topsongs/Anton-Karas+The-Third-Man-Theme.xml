      <p>" Theme" is an instrumental written and performed by Anton
    Karas for the soundtrack to the film 
    <i>The Third Man</i>(1949).</p>
      <p>Karas was working as a zither player when director Carol
    Reed, during location scouting for the film, heard him playing
    in a beer garden. Reed wanted music that wasn't waltz but would
    be appropriate to the city of Vienna, in which the film was
    set, so he asked Karas if he would write and record the film's
    score. Karas agreed, and he wrote the theme based on a melody
    in a practice book. The zither had not previously been widely
    used in English or American music, but the theme became popular
    with audiences of the film soon after its premiere.</p>
      <p>This song was originally released in the U.K. in 1949, where
    it was 'The Harry Lime Theme.' Following its release in the
    U.S. in 1950 (see 1950 in music), "
    <i>The Third Man</i>Theme" spent eleven weeks at number one on 
    <i>Billboard'</i>s U.S. Best Sellers in Stores chart, from
    April 23 to July 8. Its success led to a trend in releasing
    film theme music as singles. A guitar version by Guy Lombardo
    (recorded December 9, 1949, released by Decca under catalog
    number 24839) also sold strongly, and four other versions
    charted in the U.S. during 1950. According to Faber and Faber,
    the different versions of the theme have collectively sold an
    estimated forty million copies.</p>
      <p>"
    <i>The Third Man</i>Theme" was used in a 1982 TV mail-order
    record collection, 
    <i>Aerobic Dancing</i>, with Sharon Barbano.</p>
      <p>"The Third Man Theme" is also used as a theme for Japan
    Rail's Yamanote line train station at Ebisu Station (Tokyo) in
    Tokyo Japan. When a train arrives at the platform the initial
    portion of this theme will play. It is known in Japan as the
    "Ebisu Theme" which was used in early Ebisu beer commercials.
    Ebisu train station was located at the site of the former
    Yebisu#Brands beer factory which is were the station takes its
    name and why the theme is used at this train station to this
    day.</p>
