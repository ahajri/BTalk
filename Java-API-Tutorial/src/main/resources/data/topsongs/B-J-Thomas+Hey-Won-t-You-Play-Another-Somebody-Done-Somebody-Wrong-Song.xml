      <p>"(Hey Won't You Play) Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong
    Song" is an American country and pop song made famous by B.J.
    Thomas.</p>
      <p>The song became Thomas' second number-one single on the
    Billboard Hot 100 in April 1975. In addition, it ascended to
    the top of the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot Country Singles chart three weeks after
    reaching its peak on the pop chart. The song topped 
    <i>Billboard'</i>s Easy Listening chart as well. On top of all
    of this, it is also the longest-titled number-one song to
    date.</p>
      <p>Although he wouldn't have any major country hits for another
    eight years, "Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song" — as
    the song is sometimes referred to — paved the way for Thomas'
    future success as a mainstream artist in that genre.</p>
      <p>"(Hey Won't You Play) Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong
    Song" was certified gold for sales of one million units by the
    Recording Industry Association of America. [1]</p>
