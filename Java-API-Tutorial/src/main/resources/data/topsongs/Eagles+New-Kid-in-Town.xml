      <p>"New Kid In Town", written by Don Henley, Glenn Frey and
    J.D. Souther, is a song by the Eagles, from their 1976 album 
    <i>Hotel California</i>. Released as the first single from the
    album, the song became a #1 hit in the USA, and #20 in the UK.
    The single version has an earlier fade-out than the album
    version does. On 26 February 1977, it reached the Billboard #1.
    The song features Glenn Frey singing the lead vocals, with Don
    Henley singing main harmony vocals. Randy Meisner plays the
    guitarr√≥n mexicano, and Joe Walsh plays the electric piano and
    organ parts.</p>
      <p>In 1977, the Eagles won a Grammy Award for Best Arrangement
    for Voices with "New Kid In Town".</p>
      <p>On Henley's first solo album, I Can't Stand Still, he
    references the song by singing the line, "there's a new kid in
    town" over the rideout of Johnny Can't Read.</p>
