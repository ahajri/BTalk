      <p>"Silly Love Songs" is a song written and sung by Paul
    McCartney with his band Wings in 1976. The song was released as
    a single and included on the album 
    <i>Wings at the Speed of Sound</i>. The US single was released
    on 1 April 1976 and reached number one on the Billboard Hot
    100. The UK single was released on 30 April 1976 and reached
    number two on the UK Singles Chart.</p>
      <p>In addition to a comment about "silly love songs" by John
    Lennon, McCartney had often been teased by music critics for
    writing lightweight songs, and he wrote this number in
    response. "Silly Love Songs" was McCartney's first foray into
    the then-popular disco sound, with his bass guitar taking a
    lead role against a steady disco-style drumbeat. As such, it
    was the forerunner for other 1960s-era British musicians trying
    their hand at disco; examples that followed included The
    Rolling Stones' "Miss You" and Rod Stewart's "Da Ya Think I'm
    Sexy?".</p>
      <p>Linda McCartney and Denny Laine's vocals are heard, doing
    the counterpoint portions during the "I Love You" parts, while
    Paul sings lead.</p>
      <p>The song lists at number 31 on 
    <i>Billboard's Greatest Songs of All Time</i>.</p>
