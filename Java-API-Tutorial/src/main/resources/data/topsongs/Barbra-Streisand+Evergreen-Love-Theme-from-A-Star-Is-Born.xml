      <p>"Evergreen (Love Theme from )" is the well known theme song
    from the 1976 film 
    <i>A Star Is Born</i>. It was composed and performed by Barbra
    Streisand with lyrics by Paul Williams. The song was released
    on the soundtrack to 
    <i>A Star Is Born</i>.</p>
      <p>Streisand earned an Academy Award for Best Original Song,
    her second overall, as composer of the song. With "Evergreen",
    Streisand earned a Grammy Award for Song of the Year as well.
    She and Williams also won Golden Globes in the category of Best
    Original Song for the song.</p>
      <p>The single was a worldwide success, spending three weeks at
    #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and six weeks atop the adult
    contemporary chart. This was Streisand's second Hot 100 #1 song
    (following "The Way We Were" in 1974), and her third
    chart-topper on the adult contemporary chart ("The Way We Were"
    and 1964's "People").</p>
      <p>Streisand also recorded versions of the song in Spanish
    ("Tema de Amor de Nace Una Estrella"), French ( "De Reve en
    Reverie"), and Italian ("Sempreverde"). Of these versions, only
    the Spanish version of the song has been released commercially
    as a track on the CD single, "I Finally Found Someone", a duet
    with Bryan Adams and on the import CD version of the "A Star is
    Born" remastered soundtrack.</p>
      <p>Songwriter Paul Williams recorded the song for his album
    "Classics" (1977). British singer Hazell Dean recorded a dance
    version of the song. It was released as a single in 1984.
    Luther Vandross recorded the song for his
    album"Songs"(1994).</p>
