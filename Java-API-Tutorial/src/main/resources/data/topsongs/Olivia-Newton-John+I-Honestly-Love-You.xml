      <p>"I Honestly Love You" was a worldwide pop hit single for
    Olivia Newton-John in 1974. The song was Newton-John's first
    number-one single in the United States and Canada, thus
    cementing her as a household name in North America. Released on
    the 
    <i>Long Live Love</i>album in the United Kingdom by EMI, it was
    eventually released on the album 
    <i>If You Love Me, Let Me Know</i>in the United States on MCA.
    The song was written by Jeff Barry and the Australian composer
    Peter Allen; the latter recorded it around the same time on his
    album 
    <i>Continental American</i>. VH1 placed the song at #11 in the
    "40 Most Softsational Soft-Rock Songs" list.</p>
      <p>The song topped the charts in the U.S. on October 5, 1974,
    and went on to sell over two million copies, being certified
    Platinum. It also reached number one (three weeks) on the Adult
    Contemporary charts and number six on the Country charts, and
    won Grammy Awards for Female Pop Vocal Performance and Record
    of the Year. The song's success also helped propel its parent
    album, 
    <i>If You Love Me, Let Me Know</i>, to number one. Its title
    song was released as a single prior to "I Honestly Love You",
    and it was also a top-five multi-format (Pop - No. 5, Adult
    Contemporary - No. 2, and Country - No. 2) hit. By contrast,
    the single failed to reach the top-twenty in the United Kingdom
    (#22), although it did chart there in 1983 when it was
    re-released to promote a Newton-John greatest hits album.</p>
      <p>Newton-John re-released the original hit version of the song
    in 1977, backed with "Don't Cry For Me Argentina" from her
    then-current album 
    <i>Making a Good Thing Better</i>, and it reached number
    forty-eight Pop (outperforming the only single from 
    <i>Making A Good Thing Better</i>, the title song, which
    stalled at number eighty-seven). The song also recharted on the
    Adult Contemporaries at No. 49.</p>
      <p>This song also recharted on the Adult Contemporaries at No.
    49. In 1998, she released a new version of "I Honestly Love
    You" from her album Back With a Heart, which featured Babyface
    on background vocals and reached number sixty-seven on the
    Billboard Hot 100, her first U.S. charted single in six years.
    The 1998 version also charted on the AC chart, No. 18, and in
    Country Music Sales, No. 16.</p>
      <p>During the 1990s, this song was used in Australia to
    advertise tourism for Tasmania.</p>
      <p>It was the first number one in the chart rundown to be shown
    on long-running Australian pop series Countdown.</p>
      <p>The song is performed in the musical 
    <i>The Boy from Oz</i>.</p>
      <p>The song was covered by Bobby Vinton on his album 
    <i>Melodies of Love</i>.</p>
      <p>The song was performed regularly by the legendary Hong Kong
    singing icon Leslie Cheung.</p>
      <p>Olivia Newton-John also reprised the song with her daughter
    Chloe Lattanzi on MTV, shortly after Chloe's notable turn on
    the VH-1 series "Rock the Cradle". The MTV version of the song
    was markedly different in terms of its significantly shorter
    duration, its instrumentalization relying on orchestral strings
    and deep bass notes, and its "dark" tone, in stark contrast to
    the original, which was a "bubble-gum" pop love ballad. In the
    performance, Chloe donned a so-caller "provocative" outfit and
    sang the first verse before being joined by her mother for the
    chorus. Newton-John sat on a throne during the performance with
    her daughter beside her.</p>
      <p>The song was briefly mentioned in the 2001 film 
    <i>The Wedding Planner</i>, which starred Jennifer Lopez and
    Matthew McConaughey. Lopez's character Mary mentions that any
    couple who chooses the song for their wedding song is doomed to
    divorce in under a year.</p>
