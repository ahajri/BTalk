      <p>"Something About the Way You Look Tonight" is a song by
    Elton John, released as the first single from 
    <i>The Big Picture</i>. The single was released as a double
    A-side single with "Candle in the Wind 1997".</p>
      <p>The video for the song featured actors and actresses from
    the UK television programme 
    <i>This Life</i>, as well as supermodels Kate Moss and Sophie
    Dahl and is regarded as one of Elton John's best videos. John
    has publicly revealed (through his "warts and all" documentary 
    <i>Tantrums and Tiaras</i>) that he finds videos "fucking
    loathsome" and after the album 
    <i>The Big Picture</i>refrained from appearing in his own
    videos unless they were cameo appearances.</p>
      <p>"Something About the Way You Look Tonight" and the video
    were dedicated (and maybe this inspired the song) to the memory
    of Gianni Versace, murdered that year.</p>
      <p>In the UK only, the single sold over 4,864,600 copies (8x
    Platinum), making the song the best-selling single ever in UK
    history. It remained for five weeks at the number-one position.
    In the US, the song was considered a double-A-side with "Candle
    in the Wind 1997" and spent fourteen weeks at number one on the
    Billboard Hot 100. On the US adult contemporary chart, however,
    "Something About the Way You Look Tonight" and "Candle in the
    Wind 1997" charted separately, and while the tribute to
    Princess Diana peaked at #5 on this chart, "Something About the
    Way You Look Tonight" spent ten weeks at #1 in late 1997 and
    early 1998.</p>
