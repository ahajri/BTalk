      <p>"You Make Me Feel Like Dancing" is a popular song by the
    British singer Leo Sayer, taken from his 1976 album 
    <i>Endless Flight</i>. The song reached #1 on the Hot 100
    chart, making it his first number one single in United States,
    and #2 on the UK Singles Chart. Songwriters Sayer and Vini
    Poncia won a Grammy Award for the song in 1978 in the category
    Best R&amp;B Song.</p>
      <p>In 2006, the song "I Don't Feel Like Dancin' by the American
    band Scissor Sisters was often compared with Sayer's song
    because of its tempo, arrangement and subject matter.</p>
      <p>Sayer re-recorded the song with The Wiggles in 2008 for a
    Wiggles DVD, also entitled 
    <i>You Make Me Feel Like Dancing</i>.</p>
