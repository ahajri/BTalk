      <p>"Foolish" is a song by American R&amp;B singer Ashanti from
    her debut album. It was written by Ashanti, 7 Aurelius, M.
    DeBarge and producer Irv Gotti. It uses a sample of DeBarge's
    "Stay with Me" and features elements from "One More Chance
    (remix)" by The Notorious B.I.G. and M.V.P by Big L.</p>
      <p>The song was released as the album's lead single on January
    29, 2002 (see 2002 in music), It spent ten weeks at number-one
    on the Hot 100 and U.S. 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot R&amp;B Songs chart. The song became
    Ashanti's second number-one and third top ten on both charts.
    The song was in the top ten in United Kingdom, Australian and
    New Zealand.</p>
      <p>In 2009 it was named the 19th most successful song of the
    2000s, on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot 100 Songs of the Decade.</p>
      <p>The filming session of the video for the single took place
    during January 2002. It was directed by Irv Gotti himself. The
    video grants us an insight of a relationship where the man,
    played by Terrence Howard, gets involved into some criminal
    acts, cheats on Ashanti, which ends up in a break-up after some
    quarrel. As the song suggests, Ashanti feels that she still
    loves her ex and that she just can't seem to get over him and
    becomes frusturated since her heart and her mind force her to
    love him and hate him at the same time. In supporting roles we
    can also see Charli Baltimore, Vita, Ja Rule and Irv Gotti. The
    video is set in the fashion of the movie 
    <i>Goodfellas</i>, with Ashanti in the role of Karen Hill and
    Terrence Howard in the role of Henry Hill. Irv Gotti and Ja
    Rule are also in a scene appearing to take the roles of Jimmy
    Conway and Paulie Cicero. The video was a three-time nominee at
    the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards for 
    <i>Best Female Video</i>, 
    <i>Best R&amp;B Video</i>, and 
    <i>Best New Artist</i>.</p>
      <p>The song was nominated at the 2003 Grammy Awards for 
    <i>Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance - Female</i>, and Ashanti for
    
    <i>Best New artist</i>and won a Soul Train Music Award for 
    <i>Best R&amp;B/Soul Single for Female</i>
      </p>
      <p>There are several Ashanti publications and releases under
    the name "Foolish" and "Unfoolish" and inspired by the single
    (or vice-versa). A book called 
    <i>Foolish/Unfoolish - Reflections on love</i>contains
    Ashanti's teenage poems and diary extracts. It was followed by
    an audio book with the same name defined as 
    <i>A spoken word album - read by the author</i>released by
    Hyperion.</p>
