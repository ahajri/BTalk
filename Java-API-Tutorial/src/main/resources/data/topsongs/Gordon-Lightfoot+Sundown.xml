      <p>"Sundown" is one of the most popular songs by Canadian folk
    artist Gordon Lightfoot. Released in 1974, "Sundown" allowed
    Lightfoot to regain the momentum that his career had taken
    three years earlier with "If You Could Read My Mind" and other
    songs.</p>
      <p>It reached number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and
    adult contemporary charts, as well as number thirteen on the
    country chart.</p>
      <p>"Sundown" was inspired by his then girlfriend, Cathy Smith,
    later more infamously known for her involvement in the death of
    John Belushi. Lightfoot has commented in interviews that she
    was "the one woman in my life who most hurt me."</p>
      <p>Engineered by Lee Herschberg, Recorded at Eastern Sound
    Studios, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.</p>
