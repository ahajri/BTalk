      <p>"Rag Mop" was a popular American song of the late
    1940s-early 1950s.</p>
      <p>The song, a 12-bar blues, was written by Johnnie Lee Wills
    and Deacon Anderson and published in 1949. Considered a novelty
    song, the lyrics consisted mostly of spelling out the title of
    the song; because of the spelling used in the song, it is
    sometimes referred to as "Ragg Mopp."</p>
      <p>The most popular version of this song was recorded by The
    Ames Brothers, and released by Coral Records as catalog number
    60140. The song was part of a double-sided hit; the flip side
    was "Sentimental Me." The record first reached the Billboard
    magazine charts on January 6, 1950 and lasted 14 weeks on the
    chart, peaking at #1. The song was re-released in 1951 by Coral
    as catalog number 60397, with the flip side "Hoop-Dee-Doo". The
    group re-recorded the song several times. The 1950 recording is
    considered an example of proto-rock and roll as it contained
    elements that would later go into the defining of the
    genre.</p>
      <p>In a cartoon episode of 
    <i>Beany and Cecil</i>, entitled "D.J. the D.J", from the
    1960s, Cecil sang "Rag Mopp" with two dogs.</p>
      <p>This song played on M*A*S*H in Season 9, Episode 6, after
    Hawkeye and BJ ordered a radio from the Sears Catalog.</p>
      <p>Danny Kaye used a variation of "Rag Mop" for the 1962
    baseball song "Dodgers Song" (Oh,Really, No, O'Malley),
    spelling the names "Dem Bums" and "Jints" for the name of the
    opposing team "Giants"</p>
      <p>Allan Sherman parodied this song in 1963 for his album 
    <i>My Son, the Nut</i>; he renamed it 
    <i>Rat Fink</i>. According to numerous biographies, "Rag Mop"
    was also one of the first songs Elvis Presley tried out at his
    first Sun Records recording session in 1954, although no actual
    recording of him performing the song has to date surfaced. "Rag
    Mop" by the Ames Brothers was the last single release to hit #1
    on the popular charts (Billboard) that was released only on
    "78" speed at the time of its popularity. After this point in
    popular music history, every song to hit #1 was released on a
    45 rpm record.</p>
