      <p>"Sheila" is a song written and recorded by Tommy Roe with
    the help of Robert Bosch. The single reached number one on the
    U.S. Billboard Hot 100 on September 1, 1962, remaining in the
    top position for two weeks and peaking at number six on the
    R&amp;B charts .</p>
      <p>The original version of the song was recorded by Roe for
    Judd Records in 1960 with his then backing group The Satins,
    but it failed to sell.</p>
      <p>A build up of global sales of "Sheila" meant that the
    R.I.A.A. did not present the gold record until 1969.</p>
