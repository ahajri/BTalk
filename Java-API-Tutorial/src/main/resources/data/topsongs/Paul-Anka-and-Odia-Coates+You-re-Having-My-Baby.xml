      <p>"(You're) Having My Baby" is a song written and recorded by
    Canadian popular music singer Paul Anka. Recorded as a duet
    with female vocalist Odia Coates, the song became Anka's first
    No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in 15 years. Despite its
    commercial success, the song regularly appears in "worst song"
    lists and was voted the #1 "Worst Song of All Time" in a poll
    conducted by CNN.com.</p>
      <p>Anka — whose last chart-topping hit was 1959's "Lonely Boy"
    — had written the song for his wife and their four daughters
    while appearing at Lake Tahoe. The song, meant to celebrate the
    joy and anticipation of being a father-to-be, quickly gained
    notoriety with the National Organization for Women, who gave
    Anka the "Keep Her in Her Place" award.</p>
      <p>Originally, the song was to be a solo effort by Anka. But
    the unknown Coates, whom Anka had met while on tour, was at the
    studio during the recording session. Upon suggestion by United
    Artists recording executive Bob Skaff, the song became a
    duet.</p>
      <p>Released in late June 1974, the mellow-sounding "(You're)
    Having My Baby" quickly climbed the chart and became Anka's
    third No. 1 song. A follow-up single — "One Man Woman/One Woman
    Man" — reached the Top 10 in early 1975.</p>
      <p>At about the same time "(You're) Having My Baby" was
    climbing the Hot 100, a female country vocalist named Sunday
    Sharpe recorded a cover version called "I'm Having Your Baby."
    With lyrics altered to the female perspective but otherwise
    identical to Anka's version, "I'm Having Your Baby" peaked at
    No. 11 on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot Country Singles chart in October 1974.</p>
      <p>"(You're) Having My Baby" was covered on the first season of
    
    <i>Glee</i>.</p>
