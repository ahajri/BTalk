      <p>"Love Bites" is a power ballad recorded by British rock band
    Def Leppard in 1987 on the album 
    <i>Hysteria</i>. It is Def Leppard's only number-one single on
    the Billboard Hot 100 to date.</p>
      <p>The title "Love Bites" was originally used for a very
    different song that was eventually re-titled "I Wanna Be Your
    Hero", and which appeared as a 
    <i>Hysteria</i>B-side and later on the album 
    <i>Retro Active</i>.</p>
      <p>Following the huge momentum generated by "Pour Some Sugar On
    Me", the song was released in August of 1988 and quickly shot
    to the top of the U.S. charts, dethroning Bobby McFerrin's
    "Don't Worry Be Happy". It stayed there for one week before
    giving up the position to UB40's "Red Red Wine". The song also
    hit number eleven in the UK (their second best showing from the
    album).</p>
      <p>"Love Bites" was ranked #8 on the list of "VH1's 25 Greatest
    Power Ballads" and #52 on the list of "VH1's 100 Greatest Love
    Songs".</p>
      <p>A popular rumor about the song concerns the final seconds.
    After the line "If you got love in your sights, Watch out, Love
    Bites", what is seemingly heard is "Jesus of Nazareth, Go to
    Hell". This rumor has been refuted by the band, most notably on
    a 
    <i>Hysteria</i>documentary. The line is in fact producer Mutt
    Lange rambling in a Yorkshire accent, to the effect of "Yes it
    does, It Will Be Hell", with the aid of a vocoder.</p>
