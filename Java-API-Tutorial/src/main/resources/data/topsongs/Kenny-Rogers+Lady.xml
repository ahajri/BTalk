      <p>"Lady" is a song made famous by American country and pop
    music singer Kenny Rogers.</p>
      <p>It is listed at #47 on 
    <i>Billboard's All Time Top 100.</i>[1]</p>
      <p>The song was written and produced by Lionel Richie, and
    ranks among Rogers' biggest hits. Recorded in 1980, Rogers once
    told an interviewer, "The idea was that Lionel would come from
    R&amp;B and I'd come from country, and we'd meet somewhere in
    pop."</p>
      <p>The success of "Lady" also proved instrumental to Richie's
    career. The production work on the song was his first outside
    the Commodores and foreshadowed his success as a solo act
    during the 1980s. Rogers was also a featured vocalist on "We
    Are the World," co-written by Richie.</p>
      <p>Since his breakup with the First Edition, Rogers had tasted
    considerable success as a solo act, with nine No. 1 entries on
    the 
    <i>Billboard magazine</i>Hot Country Singles chart (prior to
    the release of "Lady"), plus several Top 10 hits on the
    Billboard Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary Singles charts.</p>
      <p>"Lady," according to music historian Fred Bronson, would
    prove to be an important record for both Richie and Rogers. It
    became the first record of the 1980s to chart on all four of 
    <i>Billboard magazine's</i>singles charts - country, Hot 100,
    adult contemporary and Top Black Singles.</p>
      <p>It reached No. 1 on three of those charts in late 1980,
    including a six-week run on the Hot 100 and one week on the Hot
    Country Singles chart. "Lady" also peaked at number forty-two
    on the Top Black Singles chart..</p>
      <p>As a country entry, "Lady" was Rogers' 10th chart-topping
    hit in a career that saw him collect 20 No. 1 songs between
    1977 and 2000. On the Hot 100, it was his only solo
    chart-topping song, although Rogers would have a duet No. 1
    three years later (1983's "Islands in the Stream" with Dolly
    Parton). On the Adult Contemporary Singles chart, "Lady" was
    Rogers' second (of eight) songs that reached the chart's
    summit.</p>
