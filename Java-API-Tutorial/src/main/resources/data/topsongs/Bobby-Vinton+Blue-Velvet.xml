      <p>"Blue Velvet" is a popular song, written by Bernie Wayne and
    Lee Morris, that has been recorded by several artists. It was
    first a hit for Tony Bennett in 1951, when it peaked at #16 on
    the Billboard Best Selling Pop Singles Chart (the predecessor
    of the Billboard Hot 100). A 1955 version of the song by The
    Clovers reached #14 on the Billboard Rhythm &amp; Blues chart.

    Billboard Hot 100 on September 21, 1963, and held the top spot
    for three weeks. It also spent eight weeks atop the U.S. adult
    contemporary chart. Vinton's version of "Blue Velvet" failed to
    make the British charts when it was first released, but a
    re-released version in 1990 went to #2 in the United Kingdom.
