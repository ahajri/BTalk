      <p>"Jump" is a song recorded by the rock group Van Halen. It is
    the only single the group released in their career to reach
    number one on the U.S. Hot 100. It was released in 1984 as the
    second track on the album 
    <i>1984</i>. The song breaks the mold of earlier Van Halen
    songs, mainly in its rolling synth line (played on an Oberheim
    OB-Xa), although the song contains the standard Eddie Van Halen
    guitar solo, which Eddie claims as his favorite solo he never
    wrote. This refers to the fact that the producer spliced parts
    of two different takes to create the one heard in the song.</p>
      <p>"Jump" may be Van Halen's most popular and instantly
    recognizable composition, perhaps because its sound embodies
    the key aspects of both of the two genres of popular music most
    associated with the 1980s in America: synth-driven pop and
    "arena"-style metal. Its synthesized brass introduction is one
    of popular music's most recognizable musical introductions. It
    was inspired by famed martial artist, Benny Urquidez. who Roth
    was a student of. The song changed the future and style of Van
    Halen from being a predominantly hard rock band to one of more
    radio-oriented popular music.</p>
      <p>According to Daryl Hall of Hall &amp; Oates, "[Eddie] Van
    Halen told me that he copied the synth part from 'Kiss on My
    List' and used it in ‘Jump.’ I don't have a problem with that
    at all."</p>
      <p>Following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the
    song was placed on the list of post-9/11 inappropriate titles
    distributed by Clear Channel.</p>
      <p>This stylistic change was further cemented when it seemed to
    create severe tensions between Eddie Van Halen and David Lee
    Roth. Roth, it has been claimed, wanted the band to avoid using
    synthesizers and focus more on traditional hard rock. This
    conflict eventually ended in Roth's departure from the band. In
    the 1995 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>cover story on/interview with Eddie Van
    Halen (RS #705, dated April 6) the circumstances surrounding
    Roth's leaving are discussed. In this interview Eddie claims
    that the main reason for the split was that Roth and Templeman
    both disliked the fact that he had built his own studio and was
    able to work on music away from their influence. He said that
    "the first thing I did up here was "Jump" and they [Roth and
    Templeman] didn't like it. I said 'take it or leave it', I was
    getting sick of their ideas of what was commercial ... At first
    [Roth's solo EP] 
    <i>Crazy From the Heat</i>was great because Roth laid off me a
    bit. Little did I know he was testing the waters. Then he
    called me up and asked me to go to his house and said he was
    going to make a 
    <i>Crazy From the Heat</i>movie. He had some deal that fell
    through. But at the time I was depressed. I cried, then I
    called my brother and told him the guy quit."</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Roth and Templeman did work on "Jump" at
    Eddie's disputed new studio, with Roth providing the lyrics and
    the vocal melody.</p>
      <p>Ted Templeman recalls that "'Jump' was recorded at Ed's
    studio. [Engineer] Donn [Landee] and Ed put the track down
    alone in the middle of the night. We recut it once in one take
    for sonic reasons. Dave wrote the lyrics that afternoon in the
    backseat of his Mercury convertible. We finished all vocals
    that afternoon and mixed it that evening".</p>
      <p>The song thereafter secured its place among rock music's
    most popular songs, and is now considered by some to be one of
    the most influential rock songs of all time.</p>
      <p>Live performances of "Jump" is preceded by Eddie's
    synthesizer solo "1984". During the reunion tour with Roth, the
    two songs have been used for the band's encore. Roth often
    waved a large red flag during the synth section while the stage
    was still coated in dark cover lights.</p>
      <p>The music video for "Jump" was directed by David Lee Roth.
    It is a straightforward concept, much like many of the hard
    rock videos of the time. It shows the band performing the song
    at a mock concert. It was nominated for three MTV Video Music
    Awards, and won "best stage performance" for the video.</p>
      <p>The version of the song used for the video differs slightly
    from the album version. During the keyboard solo prior to the
    final refrain, David Lee Roth is heard (and seen) yelling out.
    He did this during the band's mock performance for the video's
    filming, and it is believed that afterwards he overdubbed this
    yell especially for the video version since it is not present
    in the song to begin with..</p>
      <p>"Jump" was ranked #15 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the
    80s. It has also become somewhat of a sports anthem, an example
    of this being that it is the song that is played on the PA
    system every time AC Milan score a goal at their home ground,
    San Siro. 
    <i>Jump</i>was also covered by the cast of the American musical
    comedy-drama television series Glee, in the eleventh episode
    "Mattress."</p>
