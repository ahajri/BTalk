      <p>"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?" is a 1995 song written
    by Bryan Adams, Michael Kamen and Robert John "Mutt" Lange for
    the film of the same year 
    <i>Don Juan DeMarco</i>. The melody is used as a musical motif
    throughout the film, and the song is featured three times in
    the movie, twice performed by other artists in Spanish, and
    finally performed by Adams himself during the closing credits.
    The Adams version of the song, which features flamenco
    guitarist Paco de Lucia, is featured on the soundtrack album
    and also on the album 
    <i>18 Til I Die</i>. It was at number one for five weeks on the
    Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, making it the third
    number one song for the songwriting team, and went on to earn
    them their second Oscar nomination.</p>
      <p>Various women's groups contacted Adams when the song became
    popular, which led to his publishing a series of books of
    photos, with all proceeds going to breast cancer research.</p>
      <p>The music video was shot in Spain at Casa las Pavos Reales,
    Malaga starring Cecilie Thomsen and Amira. It was directed by
    the music video director Anton Corbijn and released and aired
    in May 1995.</p>
