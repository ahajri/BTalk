      <p>Theme from was an instrumental song performed by the group
    Rhythm Heritage, and reached #1 on the Billboard Magazine Hot
    100 singles chart in the United States on Saturday, February
    28, 1976. As the title implies, it was the opening theme music
    for the 1970s American television series 
    <i>S.W.A.T.</i>, though it is a noticeably different recording
    than the actual TV theme version. It appeared on Rhythm
    Heritage's 1976 album 
    <i>Disco-fied</i>. It was also referenced by characters in the
    2003 motion picture of the same name, who mouth the notes
    during a party to celebrate their successful completion of the
    training course. In 1987, rapper and actor LL Cool J sampled
    the song for his single I'm Bad from his album Bigger and
    Deffer.</p>
