      <p>"He Don't Love You (Like I Love You)" is the title of a
    popular song sung by Tony Orlando and Dawn that was a
    number-one song in the United States during the year 1975. It
    topped the Hot 100 chart on May 3, 1975, and remained there for
    three weeks. The song also went to #1 on the U.S. adult
    contemporary chart for one week in 1975.</p>
      <p>The original title of the song was "He Will Break Your
    Heart". It was written by Jerry Butler, Calvin Carter, and
    Curtis Mayfield. The song was recorded by Butler and released
    as a single in 1960, where it peaked at #7 on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot 100 chart. In addition, Butler's recording
    spent seven, non consecutive weeks at #1 on the U.S. R&amp;B
    chart. Subsequent cover versions of "He Will Break Your Heart"
    were released by artists such as The Righteous Brothers and
    Freddie Scott.</p>
      <p>When Orlando and the members of Dawn (Telma Hopkins and
    Joyce Wilson) appeared at a Golden Globes award ceremony,
    Orlando spoke with Faye Dunaway and her then-husband, Peter
    Wolf, while waiting in a lobby. Wolf was the lead singer for
    The J. Geils Band, and the two started singing songs from the
    1960s, including "He Will Break Your Heart", which the couple
    recommended Orlando record. Orlando contacted Mayfield
    requesting that he and Dawn wanted to do a remake but change
    the title to the opening lines of the song, and Mayfield gave
    his permission.</p>
