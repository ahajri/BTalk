      <p>"Father Figure" is the U.S. number-one song written and
    performed by George Michael and released on Epic Records in
    1987 as the third single from the album 
    <i>Faith</i>.</p>
      <p>"Father Figure" is a sharp and sensual tale of seduction
    which is more than five minutes long and epitomized the sexual
    nature of Michael's writing which he had adopted since the
    latter years of Wham!.</p>
      <p>The song was actually supposed to be an uptempo dance track,
    but whilst checking his mix of the song, Michael turned off the
    snare track and realized he liked the song better without
    it.</p>
      <p>The video starred Vogue model Tania Coleridge.</p>
      <p>Released in 1987, "Father Figure" reached number eleven in
    the UK singles chart - the first time Michael had failed to
    reach the top ten in his home country. The song remained a live
    favourite at Michael's concerts for many years and is also one
    of his most frequently aired songs on the radio in the UK.</p>
      <p>In the U.S., "Father Figure" became George Michael's sixth
    number one single (counting #1 singles garnered as half of
    Wham!). "Father Figure" debuted at #49 on January 16, 1988,
    while "Faith" was still prominent (at #9) in the top tier of
    the chart. In the subsequent weeks, "Father Figure" was a
    surefire hit, reaching #1 by its seventh week, February 27,
    1988, staying at the top for two weeks. Altogether, the single
    spent 6 weeks in the Top 10, 9 weeks in the Top 20, and 14
    weeks in the Top 40.</p>
      <p>The music video depicts a relationship between a cab driver
    (George Michael) and a high fashion model (Tania Coleridge).
    Various intercut flashbacks tell a backstory that, like the
    song, can be interpreted in various ways.</p>
      <p>One possible interpretation is that it depicts the breakdown
    of a relationship. At some point in the past a cab driver and
    model began an unlikely but passionate relationship. The model,
    however, had an affair with her photographer, which she quickly
    regretted. The cab driver suspected the affair, followed her,
    and discovered the truth. At some point in the future—perhaps
    the next day, perhaps months later—he appears at a runway show
    in which she is performing, either to forgive her or to let her
    know he is aware of the affair.</p>
      <p>Another interpretation is similar to the first, except that
    the cab driver is the one with whom she is cheating, but he is
    unaware of it and his discovery of it ends the
    relationship.</p>
      <p>A completely different interpretation is that the cab driver
    is a stalker. In this interpretation, there was never a
    relationship between the cab driver and model in the first
    place, except in the cab driver's imagination. The cab driver
    was obsessed with the model (cutting out pictures of her in
    magazines and putting them on his wall, following her, etc.)
    and discovered that she was in a relationship with her
    photographer. In his mind, the cab driver substituted himself
    in place of her real lover, and convinced himself that they
    were in love. The stress of this obsession took its toll on the
    model. The final scene with the cab driver in the audience thus
    takes on a far more disturbing connotation.</p>
      <p>George Michael and Andy Morahan won "Best Direction of a
    Video" at the 1988 MTV Video Music Awards for "Father
    Figure".</p>
