      <p>"There! I've Said It Again" is a popular song written by
    Redd Evans and David Mann popularized originally by Vaughn
    Monroe in 1945, and then again in late 1963 by Bobby
    Vinton.</p>
      <p>Vinton's version topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart on
    January 4, 1964 and remained there for four weeks. This song is
    significant because it marks the dividing line between the
    "innocent years" and Rock and Roll era - more specifically, it
    was the last song to reach number one on the Hot 100 before "I
    Want to Hold Your Hand" topped the chart. The song also spent
    five weeks atop the easy listening chart. It was Vinton's third
    number-one song on both charts, following "Roses Are Red (My
    Love)" and "Blue Velvet".</p>
