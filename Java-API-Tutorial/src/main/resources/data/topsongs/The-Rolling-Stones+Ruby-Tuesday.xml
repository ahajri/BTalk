      <p>"Ruby Tuesday" is a song recorded by The Rolling Stones in
    1966, released in January 1967. The song, coupled with "Let's
    Spend the Night Together", was a number-one hit in the US and
    reached number three in the UK.</p>
      <p>Multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones played recorder, and the
    double bass was played jointly by bassist Bill Wyman (pressing
    the strings against the fingerboard) and Keith Richards (bowing
    the strings). The piano is played by Jack Nitzsche.</p>
      <p>According to Keith Richards in a 1971 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>interview, he wrote the song in a Los
    Angeles hotel room in early 1966 about a groupie he knew; he
    has also stated that it was about Linda Keith, his girlfriend
    in the mid-1960s. The song's lyrics concern an apparently
    free-spirited woman, with Jagger singing, "Who could hang a
    name on you?/When you change with every new day/Still I'm gonna
    miss you."</p>
      <p>"That's a wonderful song," Mick Jagger told Jann Wenner in
    1995. "It's just a nice melody, really. And a lovely lyric.
    Neither of which I wrote, but I always enjoy singing it." Bill
    Wyman states in 
    <i>Rolling with the Stones</i>that the song was completely
    written by Keith Richards. However, Marianne Faithfull recalls
    it differently; according to her, Brian Jones presented an
    early version of this melody to the rest of the Rolling
    Stones.. According to Victor Bockris, Richards came up with the
    basic track and the words and finished the song with Jones in
    the studio.</p>
      <p>, 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>magazine ranked the song #303 on their list
    of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The song title was the
    source of the restaurant chain of the same name.</p>
      <p>A concert rendition of the song from the Rolling Stones'
    Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour was released on the band's 1991
    concert album 
    <i>Flashpoint</i>. All post-2002 ABKCO reissues of the studio
    version of "Ruby Tuesday" on CD are missing a vocal overdub in
    the chorus.</p>
