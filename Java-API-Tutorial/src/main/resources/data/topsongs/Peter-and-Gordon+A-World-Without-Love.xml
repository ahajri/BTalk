      <p>"A World Without Love" is a song recorded by the English duo
    Peter and Gordon and released as their first single in February
    1964, reaching number one in the UK Singles Chart in April. The
    song was written by Paul McCartney and attributed to
    Lennon/McCartney. The B-side was "If I Were You" written by
    Peter and Gordon. In June 1964, "A World Without Love" topped
    the Billboard Hot 100 in the US. It was included on the duo's
    debut album in the UK, and in the US on an album of the same
    name. It is one of two songs written by Lennon/McCartney to
    reach number one in the US by an artist other than The Beatles.
    The other is 
    <i>Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds</i>by Elton John.</p>
      <p>"A World Without Love" is one of The Rock and Roll Hall of
    Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.</p>
      <p>McCartney did not think the song was good enough for The
    Beatles. Prior to giving the song to Peter and Gordon, he
    offered it to Billy J. Kramer, who rejected it.</p>
      <p>McCartney described John Lennon's reaction to the song: "The
    funny first line always used to please John. 'Please lock me
    away â€“' 'Yes, okay.' End of song."</p>
      <p>This song was never released by The Beatles and the only
    known recording of the song by any member of The Beatles is the
    original demo of the song performed by McCartney which is now
    in the possession of Peter Asher.</p>
