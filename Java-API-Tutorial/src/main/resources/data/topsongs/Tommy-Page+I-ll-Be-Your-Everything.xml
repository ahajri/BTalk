      <p>, "I'll Be Your Everything" is a 1990 song by the American
    pop music singer Tommy Page that was included on his album 
    <i>Paintings in My Mind</i>.</p>
      <p>The song was co-written by Page along with Jordan Knight and
    Danny Wood of the pop boy band New Kids on the Block. While on
    tour with the New Kids in 1989, Page was playing piano at a
    hotel one night when Knight approached him, and the two played
    piano together for a period of time. Knight played Page a verse
    from what would become "I'll Be Your Everything", a song that
    Knight wanted to save for a future solo project. The two later
    collaborated on finishing the song, and Page asked if he could
    record it for his next album. Knight agreed and produced the
    track, and fellow band members Danny Wood and Donnie Wahlberg
    participated in the project as well.</p>
      <p>Released as a single in early 1990, "I'll Be Your
    Everything" became Page's first #1 song on the Hot 100 chart in
    April 1990. The song spent one week at #1, thirteen weeks in
    the Top 40 and was certified Gold by the RIAA.</p>
