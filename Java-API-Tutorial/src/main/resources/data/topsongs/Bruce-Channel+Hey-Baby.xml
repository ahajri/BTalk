      <p>"Hey! Baby" is a song written by Margaret Cobb and Bruce
    Channel, who recorded the song in 1961. Channel co-produced the
    song with Major Bill Smith and released it on Mercury Records'
    Smash label. The song reached number one on the Hot 100 for
    three weeks, starting the week ending March 10, 1962.</p>
      <p>The song features a prominent riff from well-known harmonica
    player Delbert McClinton. According to a CNN article from 2002,
    "while touring the U.K. in 1962 with a little known group
    called The Beatles, harmonica player Delbert McClinton met John
    Lennon and gave him some harmonica tips. Lennon put the lessons
    to use right away on "Love Me Do" and later "Please Please Me".
    Lennon included the song in his jukebox, and it is also
    featured on the related compilation album.</p>
