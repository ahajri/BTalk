      <p>"That's the Way (I Like It)" is a song written by H.W. (KC)
    Casey and Richard Finch, and recorded and released in 1975 by
    KC and the Sunshine Band for their eponymous second album. The
    song was considered risque at the time because of the obvious
    meaning behind the title as well as its chorus with multiple
    "uh-huhs" and its verses. It became their second number-one hit
    on the Billboard Hot 100, and is one of the few chart-toppers
    in history to hit number one on more than one occasion during a
    one month period which it did between November and December
    1975. It topped the U.S. pop chart for one week and was
    replaced by "Fly, Robin, Fly" by Silver Convention. It returned
    to number one for an additional week after "Fly, Robin, Fly"
    completed its three-week run. The single also spent one week at
    number one on the soul singles chart. It is considered by many
    as one of the most popular of the disco era.</p>
