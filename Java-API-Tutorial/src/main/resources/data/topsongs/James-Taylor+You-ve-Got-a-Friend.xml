      <p>"You've Got a Friend" is a Grammy Award winning song from
    1971. The song, written by Carole King, was included in her
    album 
    <i>Tapestry</i>of 1971, but was made famous by James Taylor's
    cover version the same year. Taylor's rendition, released as a
    single from his own 1971 album 
    <i>Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon</i>, reached number 1 on
    the Billboard Hot 100 and number 4 on the UK Singles Chart, and
    won Grammy Awards both for Taylor (Best Pop Vocal Performance,
    Male) and King (Song of the Year).</p>
      <p>The song was recorded also during 1971 by Dusty Springfield,
    a recording that predates Taylor's version. It was recorded for
    her third album for Atlantic Records, but a dispute with the
    company meant the album was unreleased. The song was left
    unissued until 1999, when it was issued as a bonus track for
    the Rhino Records deluxe re-release of 
    <i>Dusty in Memphis</i>.</p>
      <p>Another soulful, gospel-tinged live version was recorded by
    Donny Hathaway on his 1972's 
    <i>Live</i>album and the posthumously released 
    <i>These Songs For You, Live!</i>.</p>
      <p>The Brand New Heavies with vocals by Siedah Garrett covered
    the song in 1997. This song did not appear on the US version of
    the album.</p>

      <p>"You've Got a Friend" was performed by CÃ©line Dion, Shania
    Twain, Gloria Estefan and Carole King at the 
    <i>VH1 Divas Live</i>concert on April 14, 1998. The event took
    place in New York City's Beacon Theatre. The entire concert was
    released on CD and DVD on October 6, 1998. Mariah Carey and
    Aretha Franklin also participated with this event.</p>
      <p>"You've Got a Friend" was issued as the second radio single
    to promote 
    <i>VH1 Divas Live</i>, after "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural
    Woman." It peaked at number 74 on the Belgian Flanders Airplay
    chart.</p>
