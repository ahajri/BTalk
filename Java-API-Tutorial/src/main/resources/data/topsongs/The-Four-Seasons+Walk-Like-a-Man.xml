      <p>"Walk Like a Man" is a song written by Bob Crewe and Bob
    Gaudio and originally recorded by The Four Seasons.</p>
      <p>The song features the counterpoint of Nick Massi's bass
    voice and the falsetto of lead singer Frankie Valli. It was
    their third number one hit, initially reaching the top of the
    Billboard Hot 100 on March 2, 1963, remaining there for three
    weeks.</p>
      <p>During the sessions that produced the hit recording, the
    fire department received an emergency call from the Abbey
    Victoria Hotel (the building that housed the Stea-Phillips
    Recording Studios). As producer Bob Crewe was insisting upon
    recording the perfect take, smoke and water started to seep
    into the studio as the group repeated their efforts upon
    Crewe's insistence: the room directly above the studio was on
    fire, yet Crewe blocked the studio door and continued recording
    until a few firemen used their axes on it and pulled Crewe
    out.</p>
      <p>Cover versions of the song have been recorded by other
    musicians such as the Mary Jane Girls and Divine.</p>
