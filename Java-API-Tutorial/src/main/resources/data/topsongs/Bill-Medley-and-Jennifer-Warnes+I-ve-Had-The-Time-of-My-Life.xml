      <p>"(I've Had) The Time of My Life" is a song composed by
    Franke Previte, John DeNicola, and Donald Markowitz. It was
    recorded by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes, after having been
    selected to be the finale song for the 1987 film 
    <i>Dirty Dancing</i>by choreographer Kenny Ortega and his
    assistant Miranda Garrison (who also played Vivian in the
    film).</p>
      <p>Due to the massive success of 
    <i>Dirty Dancing</i>, the single topped the Billboard Hot 100
    chart in November for one week. In the United Kingdom the song
    had two chart outings. Firstly, in November 1987 after the
    film's initial release the song peaked at #6, and again when
    the film was shown on mainstream television the song reached as
    high as #8 (January 1991).</p>
      <p>A parody was made in the animated comedy series 
    <i>The Simpsons</i>. The season 11 episode, "Faith Off" altered
    the chorus during a football game's half-time rendition,
    lending support to Homer's alma mater, Springfield University.
    It sings: "I had the halftime of my life, and I owe it all to
    S.U."</p>
