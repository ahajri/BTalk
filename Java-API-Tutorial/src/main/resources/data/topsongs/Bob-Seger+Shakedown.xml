      <p>"Shakedown" is a 1987 single by Bob Seger that is from the
    soundtrack of the film 
    <i>Beverly Hills Cop II</i>. The music was written by Harold
    Faltermeyer, who wrote the score for the film, and Keith
    Forsey, and the lyrics by Seger.</p>
      <p>The music video featured scenes from the film intercut with
    Seger and the band performing it, with some members approaching
    glam metal moves. "Shakedown" became a number-one hit on the
    Billboard Hot 100, Seger's only such top mark singles-wise, as
    well as the Album Rock Tracks chart, where it became his second
    number-one hit, spending four weeks at the top.</p>
      <p>Cover versions by an uncredited artist appeared in two
    episodes of the animated series 
    <i>Captain N: The Game Master</i>. However, due to legal
    issues, these songs have been edited out of the DVD releases of
    the show.</p>
