      <p>"Give It to Me" is a song recorded by Timbaland, with
    featured artists Nelly Furtado and Justin Timberlake, for
    Timbaland's second solo album, 
    <i>Shock Value</i>(2007). It was released as the album's first
    single (see 2007 in music). The song was nominated for the
    Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 50th
    Annual Grammy Awards.</p>
      <p>The song debuted at number eighty-seven on the U.S. Hot 100
    in February 2007, coincidentally, it was the week when
    Furtado's Say It Right took over the top spot. It reached
    number one on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot 100 chart in April—when it rose to that
    position from number forty-two in one week, making it, at the
    time, the third biggest rise to number one in the chart's
    history—because of sales of 248,000 digital downloads. It
    became Timbaland's first number-one on his own, Furtado's third
    and Timberlake's fourth consecutive. It is the sixth number-one
    produced by Timbaland &amp; Danja in under twelve months;
    others include "SexyBack", "My Love", and "What Goes
    Around...Comes Around" by Timberlake and "Promiscuous" and "Say
    It Right" by Furtado. The single also peaked at number one on
    the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Pop 100.</p>
      <p>On the UK Singles Chart, "Give It to Me" debuted at number
    eight and rose to number one the following week, with sales of
    27,760 that week. The song sold 275,000 copies in the UK as
    stated by the Official UK Charts Company. It is rumored that
    this song is about Prince for a remark he made regarding Justin
    Timberlake song "SexyBack". However A rivalry flared up between
    Timbaland and record producer Scott Storch in early 2007. The
    tension initially started on the single "Give It to Me", when
    Timbaland anonymously called out Storch, rapping, "I'm a real
    producer and you just the piano man". Timbaland confirmed that
    he was talking about Storch in an interview with MTV
    personality Sway Calloway [35]. Storch responded with the track
    "Built Like That" on February 26, 2007, featuring Philadelphia
    rapper NOX, which caused a final response by Beat-Club-rapper
    D.O.E. on the song "Piano Man". The end of the feud was
    confirmed by Timbaland in the final issue of Scratch Magazine
    [36].</p>
      <p>On February 26, 2007, the music video for "Give It to Me"
    was premiered on MTV's 
    <i>Total Request Live</i>. It shows Timbaland, Furtado, and
    Timberlake performing the song at the 2007 Grammy Awards
    pre-show concert, and is intercut with footage from a studio
    recording session and from inside Timbaland's tour bus. The
    clip also shows Furtado singing on a balcony. The video was
    directed by Paul "Coy" Allen &amp; Timbaland and appeared at
    number ninety-eight on BET's 
    <i>Notarized: Top 100 Videos of 2007</i>countdown.,</p>
      <p>The official remix is called the "Laff At Em Remix", and
    features Justin Timberlake &amp; Jay-Z. Timbaland's verse is a
    diss to producer Scott Storch.</p>
