      <p>"Sincerely" is a popular song written by Harvey Fuqua and
    Alan Freed and published in 1954.</p>
      <p>Originally recorded by The Moonglows, who scored a number
    one single on the Juke Box and number twenty pop hit with their
    original recording. . The biggest-selling version was a cover
    version recorded by The McGuire Sisters, entering the charts in
    1954 and reaching number one the next year. Although many
    Rhythm &amp; Blues collectors decry the cover version by the
    McGuire Sisters, which kept the Moonglows off the Pop charts,
    most overlook that the Moonglows' version stole lyrics from a
    1951 Dominoes tune, "That's What You're Doing To Me." The
    bridge in both songs is almost identical: "Lord, won't you tell
    me/ Why I love that woman so?/ She doesn't want me/ But I'll
    never let her go." Also of note, in 1988 country quartet the
    Forester Sisters reached #8 on the Billboard Hot Country chart
    with their remake of the song.</p>
