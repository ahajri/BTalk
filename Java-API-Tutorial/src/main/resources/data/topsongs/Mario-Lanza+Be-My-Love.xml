      <p>"Be My Love" is a popular song with lyrics by Sammy Cahn and
    music by Nicholas Brodzsky. It was published in 1950 and
    featured in the 1950 movie 
    <i>The Toast of New Orleans,</i>where it was sung by Kathryn
    Grayson and Mario Lanza. The Lanza recording of the song
    (released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-1561) was
    a million-seller and a Billboard #1 charting hit. Ray Anthony's
    cover version made the top 30 and a 1967 remake by Mel Carter
    was played primarily by easy listening stations. Luis Mariano,
    a great Spanish tenor, sang it in French. Broadway singer Jason
    Danieley also covered the song on his 2008 record, 
    <i>Jason Danieley and the Frontier Heroes</i>. Also Vytautas
    Juozapaitis, a soloist of Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet
    Theatre recorded a Lithuanian version entitled "Atminimu
    Bangos" on his debut album Negaliu Nemyleti (Can't Help Falling
    In Love) released in 2004.</p>
