      <p>"Do That to Me One More Time" is a song performed by
    American pop duo Captain &amp; Tennille. It was their second
    chart-topping hit in the U.S., following "Love Will Keep Us
    Together" from 1975. The song was included on the duo's 1979
    album, 
    <i>Make Your Move</i>. The song was written by Toni
    Tennille.</p>
      <p>After a decline in popularity from the height of their
    success in the mid-1970s, the Captain and Tennille signed with
    Casablanca Records under the guidance of Neil Bogart. "Do That
    to Me One More Time" was a comeback for the duo, but they
    failed to achieve further success on Casablanca and their
    contract was not renewed. Vocalist and songwriter Toni Tennille
    played the song for Bogart at her house with husband Daryl
    Dragon in Pacific Palisades, California on an electric piano.
    Bogart reacted enthusiastically, saying: "That's a smash!
    There's no doubt in my mind that's going to be your first
    single."</p>
      <p>"Do That to Me One More Time" became Captain &amp;
    Tennille's second and final number-one hit when it reached the
    pinnacle of the Hot 100 chart the week ending February 16,
    1980. The song had logged four consecutive weeks in the
    runner-up position on this chart behind Michael Jackson's hit
    "Rock with You" before ascending to the top of the chart. The
    song also achieved some crossover success on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>adult contemporary and R&amp;B charts. It was
    their highest-charting hit on the UK Singles Chart, where it
    reached #7 in March 1980. The duo also recorded a version of
    the song in Spanish.</p>
      <p>Dutch eurodance singer Amber included a cover version (as
    well as a remix) of "Do That to Me One More Time" on the 2001
    re-issue of her 1999 album, 
    <i>Amber</i>. Also, soul/R&amp;B singer Miki Howard covered "Do
    That to Me One More Time" on her 2006 covers album 
    <i>Pillow Talk</i>.</p>
