      <p>"It's in the Book" is a recorded comic monologue, partly
    sung, partly an exhortation in the manner of a revivalist
    preacher on the subject of Little Bo-Peep. It was marketed as a
    pop song, and made the 
    <i>Billboard</i>chart in 1952, reaching number one. It sold
    over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.</p>
      <p>It was written by Johnny Standley and Art Thorsen (BMI Work
    #744156) and released by Standley on the Capitol label.</p>
      <p>The recording can be heard in the background in the final
    scene of the 1971 film, 
    <i>The Last Picture Show</i>.</p>
