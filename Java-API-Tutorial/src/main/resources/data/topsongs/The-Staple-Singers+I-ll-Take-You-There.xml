      <p>"I'll Take You There" is a number-one single written (music
    and lyrics) by Alvertis Isbell, produced by Al Bell and
    performed by soul/gospel family band The Staple Singers,
    released on Stax Records in February of 1972 (see 1972 in
    music). The song spent a total of fifteen weeks on the charts
    and reached number one on the Hot 100.</p>
      <p>Included on the group's 1972 album 
    <i>Be Altitude: Respect Yourself</i>, "I'll Take You There"
    features lead singer Mavis Staples inviting her listeners to
    seek heaven. The song is "almost completely a call-and-response
    chorus"[1], with the introduction being lifted from a Jamaican
    instrumental reggae tune titled "The Liquidator". A large
    portion of the song is set aside for Mavis' sisters Cleotha and
    Yvonne and their father "Pops" to seemingly perform solos on
    their respective instruments. In actuality, these solos (and
    all music in the song) were recorded by the famed Muscle Shoals
    Rhythm Section. When Mavis Staples says "Daddy, now, Daddy,
    Daddy" (referring to "Pop's" guitar solo), it is actually Eddie
    Hinton who performs the solo on record. Muscle Shoals Rhythm
    Section bass player David Hood performs the song's famed bass
    line. Terry Manning added harmonica and lead electric guitar.
    Roger Hawkins played drums, Barry Beckett was on electric
    piano, and Jimmy Johnson and Raymond banks contributed guitar
    parts. The Memphis Horns played the signature soul horn
    lines.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Rolling Stone</i>editor David Fricke described this song as
    the "epitome of the Muscle Shoals Sound". It was recorded in
    Muscle Shoals, AL at the famous Muscle Shoals Sound Studios,
    and overdubbed and mixed at Ardent Studios in Memphis by
    Engineer Terry Manning.</p>
      <p>Bolstered by a "feel-good" vibe, "I'll Take You There"
    peaked at number-one on the Billboard R&amp;B Singles chart for
    four weeks May of 1972. In June, "I'll Take You There" reached
    the top of the Billboard Hot 100 for one week. . The song,
    ranked #276 on the 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time
    and inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999, remains the
    most successful and recognizable single of the Staples'
    half-century-long career.</p>
      <p>The song was used from 1997-1999 in commercials for the
    Chevrolet Malibu.</p>
