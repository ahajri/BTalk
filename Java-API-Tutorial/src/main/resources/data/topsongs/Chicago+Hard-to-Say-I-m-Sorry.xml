      <p>"Hard to Say I'm Sorry" is a ballad performed by American
    rock group Chicago, written by band member Peter Cetera and
    producer David Foster from the album 
    <i>Chicago 16</i>, released in 1982. The song hit number one
    for two weeks on the Hot 100 chart on September 11 of that
    year. It was their first top fifty hit since "No Tell Lover" in
    1978.</p>
      <p>The song, as well as the album on which it is featured, was
    a marked departure from Chicago's traditional soft rock,
    horns-driven sound, taking on a more polished and modern feel.
    There were minimal horns on the track, instead featuring more
    layered synthesizers and heavier distorted electric guitars in
    a more updated 1980's fashion. This was done to revitalize the
    band that was considered by some to be past its commercial
    prime at the time.</p>
      <p>The album version of "Hard to Say I'm Sorry" segued into a
    second song titled "Get Away," which was closer to the older
    horn-driven Chicago sound. Most adult contemporary radio
    stations at the time did not play the entire album track,
    however, choosing to cut it off just before "Hard to Say I'm
    Sorry" segued into "Get Away." About half the Top 40 radio
    stations played the longer version with "Get Away". The music
    video, itself using the album version, was shot in Greece.</p>
      <p>Deviating from Chicago's practice of having mostly band
    members playing on their albums, "Hard to Say I'm Sorry"
    featured several session musicians. The song featured producer
    David Foster on the piano, as well as three members of the
    American rock band Toto: Steve Lukather on guitar, while David
    Paich and Steve Porcaro both contributed synthesizers. The
    song's vocals were performed by Cetera and new member Bill
    Champlin.</p>
