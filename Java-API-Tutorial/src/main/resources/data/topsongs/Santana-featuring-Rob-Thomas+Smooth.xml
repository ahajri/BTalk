      <p>"Smooth" is a collaboration between Santana and Rob Thomas,
    the latter of the rock group Matchbox Twenty. The song was
    written by Rob Thomas and Itaal Shur and sung by Rob Thomas.
    Originally conceived by Shur as a song called "Room 17", the
    lyrics were stripped off and the track was given to Thomas.
    Thomas re-wrote the lyrics and melody and re-titled it
    "Smooth". Thomas acknowledged that his choice of lyrics was
    "mostly ironic". Thomas's original thought was to have George
    Michael sing the song. Thomas recorded the song as a demo to
    play for Santana. After hearing the song being sung by Thomas,
    Santana decided to have Thomas record the final version. Matt
    Serletic produced the record and it was released from Carlos
    Santana's album 
    <i>Supernatural</i>and became a massive hit in 1999, entering
    the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 on August 10, 1999, and
    spending twelve weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100
    beginning October 12, 1999. It was the first chart-topping song
    in Santana's long-running career (his previous biggest hit
    being "Black Magic Woman", number four in 1971). According to
    some charting standards, "Smooth" is Billboard's most popular
    song of all time. Though some songs have spent longer than 12
    weeks at number one, when combining total sales during the
    entire time the song has charted, "Smooth" ranks higher than
    any other. The song was the last number one hit of the
    1990s.</p>
      <p>The song won three Grammy Awards, including Record of the
    Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.
    It spent a record-breaking ten consecutive weeks at the top of
    the VSpot Top 20 Countdown, a record that held up until the
    Dixie Chicks broke it in 2006. According to 
    <i>Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits</i>by Fred Bronson, this is
    the number-one song of The Nineties (2003). A cover version of
    the song is included in the Wii version of 
    <i>Samba de Amigo</i>. Escape the Fate also recorded a cover
    version of the song for the compilation album 
    <i>Punk Goes Pop 2</i>, released on March 10, 2009.</p>
      <p>Rob Thomas wrote this song for his wife, Marisol Thomas. The
    pair married in 1999, after meeting backstage in 1998. Of
    Puerto Rican origin, she was the inspiration behind lines such
    as, "My muñequita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa" Thomas stated
    in interviews that the phrase "Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa" was
    inspired by the 1972 Elton John song Mona Lisas and Mad
    Hatters, which includes references to the 1961 Ben E. King song
    Spanish Harlem (song).</p>
      <p>On magazine's rankings of the top songs of the first fifty
    years of the Hot 100 singles chart, "Smooth" was ranked as the
    number-two song overall (behind only "The Twist) and the
    number-one rock song in the history of the chart.</p>
