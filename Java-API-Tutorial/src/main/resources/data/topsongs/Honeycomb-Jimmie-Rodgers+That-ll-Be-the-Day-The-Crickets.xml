      <p>"That'll Be the Day" is a song written by Buddy Holly and
    Jerry Allison and recorded by various artists including The
    Crickets and Linda Ronstadt. It was also the first song to be
    recorded (just as a demonstration disc) by The Quarrymen the
    skiffle group that subsequently became The Beatles. Although
    Norman Petty was given a co-writing credit on it, he was not
    actually involved in the composition, but only in the
    production of this well-known recording.</p>
      <p>The song had its genesis in a trip to the movies by Holly,
    Allison and Sonny Curtis in June 1956. The John Wayne film 
    <i>The Searchers</i>was playing. Wayne's frequently-used,
    world-weary catchphrase, "That'll be the day." inspired the
    young musicians.</p>
      <p>The version of this song that became a number-one hit on the
    1957 "Best Sellers in Stores" chart in magazine was recorded
    eight months later, at the Norman Petty studios in Clovis, New
    Mexico, on February 25, 1957, and issued on the Brunswick
    Records label three months later. The song also went to number
    two on the R&amp;B chart.</p>
      <p>Because Holly had signed a recording contract with Decca he
    was contractually prohibited from re-recording any of the songs
    recorded during the 1956 Nashville sessions for five years,
    even if Decca never released them. To dodge this, producer
    Norman Petty credited The Crickets as the artist on this new
    recording of "That'll Be the Day" to shield Buddy from possible
    legal action. Ironically, Brunswick Records was a subsidiary of
    Decca Records. Once the cat was out of the bag, Decca re-signed
    Holly to another of its subsidiaries, Coral Records, so he
    ended up with two recording contracts. His group efforts would
    be issued by Brunswick, and his solo recordings would be on
    Coral.</p>
      <p>The re-recorded version of "That'll Be the Day" was released
    by Brunswick Records on May 27, 1957, and is featured on the
    debut album by The Crickets, 
    <i>The "Chirping" Crickets</i>, which was issued on November
    27, 1957. The song is considered a classic in the rock and roll
    genre and is listed at #39 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500
    Greatest Songs of All Time.</p>
      <p>In 1958, the song was the first track ever recorded by The
    Quarrymen, who later became The Beatles; their rendition,
    intended just as a demonstration disc, was issued officially on
    the Beatles 
    <i>Anthology 1</i>in 1995. Norman Petty sold the publishing
    rights to the Buddy Holly catalogue to Paul McCartney in
    1979.</p>
      <p>Linda Ronstadt covered the song on 1976's Grammy award
    winning 
    <i>Hasten Down the Wind</i>. The single made it to number 11 on
    the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Pop Singles chart and number 27 on the
    Billboard Country Singles chart.</p>
      <p>The Flamin' Groovies covered "That'll be the Day" in 1972;
    their rendition is on the reissue of their album 
    <i>Teenage Head</i>.</p>
      <p>Paul and Barry Ryan covered the song on their debut album 
    <i>Two of a Kind</i>(Decca LP LK4878, 1967).</p>
      <p>Overboard has a rendition on their 2008 album 
    <i>Castaways</i>.</p>
