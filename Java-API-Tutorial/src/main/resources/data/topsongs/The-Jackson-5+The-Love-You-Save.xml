      <p>"The Love You Save" is a 1970 number-one hit single recorded
    by The Jackson 5 for the Motown label. It held the number-one
    spot on the soul singles chart for six weeks. It held the
    number-one position on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart for
    two weeks, from June 27 to July 4, 1970. It is the third of
    four Jackson 5 number ones released in a row (the others being
    "I Want You Back", "ABC", and "I'll Be There"). "The Love You
    Save" also features side vocals of Jermaine Jackson singing
    alongside Michael in the final "Stop! The love you save may be
    your own" besides Marlon and Tito Jackson.</p>
      <p>"The Love You Save" has one of the most distinctive melodies
    and is the most musically complex of the four number-one
    singles by The Jackson 5. The song's lyrics feature Michael and
    Jermaine Jackson warning a "fast" girl to slow down and "stop!"
    because "the love you save may be your own!"</p>
      <p>The opening exclamation of "stop" and the footstomps that
    complement the rhythm during the latter part of the song are
    allusions to the 1965 number-one Motown single by The Supremes,
    "Stop! In the Name of Love". The Jackson 5 essentially replaced
    The Supremes as Motown's main focus in the early 1970s,
    although Diana Ross, who left the group for a solo career not
    long before the release of this single, was publicized as
    having discovered the Jackson 5.</p>
      <p>Like most of the other early Jackson 5 hits, "The Love You
    Save" was written and produced by The Corporation, a team
    composed of Motown chief Berry Gordy, Freddie Perren, Alphonzo
    Mizell, and Deke Richards and recorded in Los Angeles,
    California, away from the old Motown studio at Hitsville USA in
    Detroit, Michigan.</p>
      <p>"The Love You Save" was the second single from the second
    Jackson 5 album, 
    <i>ABC</i>.</p>
