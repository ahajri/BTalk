      <p>"Baby Love" is a 1964 number-one hit recorded by The
    Supremes for the Motown label. Written and produced by Motown's
    main production team Holland–Dozier–Holland, "Baby Love," one
    of the most popular songs of the late 20th century, was the
    Supremes' most successful single.</p>
      <p>The song was ranked #324 on 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>'s list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All
    Time.</p>
      <p>It was the number-one song on the Billboard Hot 100 singles
    chart for four weeks, from October 25, 1964 to November 21,
    1964. It was also the second of five Supremes songs in a row to
    go to number one (the others are "Where Did Our Love Go," "Come
    See About Me," "Stop! In the Name of Love," and "Back in My
    Arms Again"). The song also reached number one on the UK
    Singles Chart for two weeks before being dislodged by the
    Rolling Stones' "Little Red Rooster". "Baby Love" also reached
    number one on Cash Box Magazine's R&amp;B chart .</p>
      <p>It is no small coincidence that "Baby Love" and its
    immediate predecessor, "Where Did Our Love Go," sound a lot
    alike: producers Holland–Dozier–Holland (H-D-H) worked into the
    new song all of the elements that had made the previous song a
    big hit: Diana Ross' cooing lead vocal, Florence Ballard and
    Mary Wilson's "baby-baby" backup, The Funk Brothers'
    instrumental track, and teenager Mike Valvano's footstomping.
    In addition, both Ballard and Wilson had brief solo ad-libs
    towards the end of the song on the released version (after this
    release Ross would be the only member to have any solos on the
    1960s singles). H-D-H hoped they could make lightning strike
    twice and succeeded, as "Baby Love" was an even bigger hit than
    "Where Did Our Love Go." The group did a performance of the
    song which aired on the BBC program 
    <i>Top of the Pops</i>on Thursday, October 15, 1964.</p>
      <p>Beginning with "Baby Love," The Supremes became the first
    Motown act to have more than one number-one single, and by the
    end of the decade, would have more number-one singles than any
    other Motown act (or American pop music group) with 12, a
    record they continue to hold; Stevie Wonder is currently in
    second place with ten number-one singles.</p>
      <p>"Baby Love" was included on the Supremes' second studio
    album, 
    <i>Where Did Our Love Go</i>, and was later included on the
    soundtrack to the 1975 feature film 
    <i>Cooley High</i>. It was nominated for the 1965 Grammy Award
    for Best Rhythm &amp; Blues Recording, losing to Nancy Wilson's
    "How Glad I Am".</p>
