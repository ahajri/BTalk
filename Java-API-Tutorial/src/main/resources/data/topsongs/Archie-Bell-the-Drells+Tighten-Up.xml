      <p>"Tighten Up" was a 1968 song by Houston, Texas based R&amp;B
    vocal group Archie Bell &amp; the Drells. It reached #1 on both
    the Billboard R&amp;B and pop charts in the spring of 1968. It
    is ranked #265 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of "the 500
    Greatest Songs of All Time" and is one of the earliest 
    <i>funk hits</i>in music history.</p>
      <p>"Tighten Up" was written by Archie Bell and Billy Buttier .
    It was one of the first songs that Archie Bell &amp; the Drells
    recorded, in a session in 1967, along with a number of songs
    including "She's My Woman". Soon afterwards Bell was drafted
    into the U.S. Army and began serving in Vietnam. The song
    became a hit in Houston, and was picked up by Atlantic Records
    for distribution in April 1968. By the summer it topped both
    the Billboard R&amp;B and pop charts. It also sold a million
    copies by May 1968, gaining an R.I.A.A. gold disc. The line in
    "Tighten Up", "we dance just as good as we walk" was a little
    ironic, given that Bell had been shot in the leg and was
    consigned to a military hospital bed at the time.</p>
      <p>The introduction features Bell introducing himself as being
    from Houston, Texas. According to the Billboard Book of Number
    One Hits by Fred Bronson, Bell heard a comment after the
    Kennedy assassination in Dallas, that "nothing good ever came
    out of Texas." Bell wanted his listeners to know "we were from
    Texas and we were good."</p>
      <p>The song described an accompanying dance that the band had
    invented, also called the "Tighten Up"; this dance became
    popular concurrently with the song.</p>
      <p>The phenomenal success of the single prompted the band to
    rush out an album, despite their incapacitated leader. In 1969
    the group recorded their first full album with Gamble and Huff,
    
    <i>I Can't Stop Dancing</i>, which reached number 28 on the
    R&amp;B chart.</p>
