      <p>"My Boo" is a duet between American R&amp;B singer Usher and
    Alicia Keys, written by Usher. Set over a hip hop-style track,
    the song was produced by Dupri. It was included on the
    re-release of Usher's fourth studio album, 
    <i>Confessions</i>(2004). The song received mixed reviews from
    critics, and has garnered awards.</p>
      <p>The song was released as the album's fourth single in 2004.
    The single stayed on top of the Hot 100 for six weeks, making
    it the third most-successful single from the album after
    "Yeah!" and "Burn", respectively. It was also ranked as the
    36th best song of the 2000-2009 decade.</p>
      <p>Usher and American R&amp;B/soul singer Alicia Keys had
    previously collaborated with the remix of Keys' 2004 single "If
    I Ain't Got You", which was released in the United Kingdom.
    During the production of Usher's fourth studio album, 
    <i>Confessions</i>, they thought for various female singers to
    pair him with on the song, including Beyonce. Usher and
    Beyonce's rare demo version can be found floating on the
    internet. However, Jermaine Dupri, who co-wrote the song
    including Usher's number-one hits "Yeah!", "Burn", and
    "Confessions Part II", felt that he had established good
    relationship with Keys since she had worked with him and
    Usher.</p>
      <p>The song is written from the perspectives of Keys and Usher,
    who play the role of a couple who have had relationship in the
    past. For him, Usher and Keys "talk about how they used to be
    in love and how those feelings are still lingering despite the
    two not being involved anymore." For Keys, "The song is talking
    about the first person you ever really had feelings for. Even
    though you move on and meet new people, you always remember
    that first person."</p>
      <p>"My Boo" is a hip hop-tinged R&amp;B song with a mid-tempo
    melody. It is composed in the key of D minor, in common time.
    The lyrics are constructed in verse-chorus-chorus form. Usher
    starts the intro, and Keys followed her rap-intro, with
    background vocals from Usher. He proceeds to the first verse
    and chorus, leading to Keys singing another chorus, altering
    some of the lyrics of the original chorus to create a dialogue.
    Keys sings the second verse and Usher for the chorus, with
    background vocals from Keys. Keys repeats her version for the
    chorus. The song breaks with Usher and Keys singing "My oh, My
    oh, My oh, My oh, My Boo", one after the other. Usher repeats
    the chorus again, and they sing the intro of Keys.</p>
      <p>"My Boo" was among the songs that were not included in the
    final track listing of 
    <i>Confessions</i>, including "Red Light" and songs recorded
    Usher recorded with P. Diddy and The Neptunes. "My Boo" and
    "Red Light" were leaked to the internet, along with other
    records that were not included during the first release. The
    song was included in the expanded version of 
    <i>Confessions</i>, alongside "Red Light" and "Sweet Lies"
    which were only released in the UK version of the album.</p>
      <p>Dupri thought of releasing "My Boo" as the fourth single
    from 
    <i>Confessions</i>once "Confessions Part II" would be leaving
    the charts. The single was released in the United States as a
    12" single on September 21, 2004. It was a double–A side with
    "Confessions Part II" when it was released in the United
    Kingdom on December 28, 2004. "My Boo" was re-released in the
    United Kingdom on January 18, 2005.</p>
      <p>The song received mixed reviews from critics. Azeem Ahmad of
    OMH Media proposed to ban "My Boo" because he felt that the
    collaboration was a competition among Usher and Alicia Keys
    "over the hip-pop like beat". Jon Caramanica of 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>found the duet sentimental.</p>
      <p>At the 2005 Grammy Awards, it was nominated for Best R&amp;B
    Song and Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with
    Vocals; to which it won the latter and the former was awarded
    to Alicia Keys' song, "You Don't Know My Name". Usher and Keys
    won for Best R&amp;B/Soul Single by a Duo or Group during the
    2005 Soul Train Music Awards.</p>
      <p>"My Boo" was successful in the United States, living up to
    the chart performances of "Yeah!", "Burn" and "Confessions Part
    II". The single debuted on the Hot 100 twenty-nine, the highest
    U.S. entry among all singles released from the album. It
    entered the top ten, two weeks after, and peaked at number one
    during its eighth-week stay on the chart. The single remained
    on the top for six weeks, beating its predecessor "Confessions
    Part II", which charted at number one for two weeks. However,
    it failed to match the success of "Yeah!" and "Burn" for
    twelve- and eight-week run on the top, respectively. It stayed
    on the top ten for nineteen weeks, leaving the chart after
    twenty-six weeks. The single was successful on 
    <i>Billboard</i>component charts, topping the Hot
    R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Ringtones.</p>
      <p>In Europe, the single had divided responses. The single
    reached the top five in United Kingdom, Germany, the
    Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland. It entered the top twenty
    in France, Finland and Switzerland, and top thirty in
    Austria.</p>
      <p>Directed by music video director Chris Robinson, "My Boo"
    clip was filmed in a New York City subway. The storyline of the
    video is a reflection of the song's lyrics.</p>
      <p>The footage starts with Usher in a living room watching a
    video for "Bad Girl", a song from 
    <i>Confessions</i>. The "Bad Girl" intro features Usher singing
    the song in a club setting while admiring a scantily-dressed
    woman. He turns the set off and slumps down on the sofa before
    laying on it with his foot propped up. After a moment of
    silent, nostalgic reflection, he begins to sing the intro of
    "My Boo". The video then shows him and Alicia Keys in their
    separate quarters, preparing to head out, while singing their
    part of the song. Usher eventually steps out on streets of New
    York; likewise, Keys is riding aback of a taxi. She leaves the
    taxi and walks down the street, and the couple meet up in the
    middle of Times Square, cuddling each other and on the brink of
    kissing.</p>
      <p>The music video debuted on MTV's 
    <i>Total Request Live</i>at number nine on September 16, 2004.
    It remained on the countdown for twenty-seven days, becoming
    the only 
    <i>Confession</i>video to chart.</p>
      <p>Usher recorded "My Boo" aside from Keys with various female
    artists. He collaborated with fellow R&amp;B singer Solange who
    sung Keys' part, although it was widely believed at the time
    that it was her sister Beyoncé. Brandy and Usher recorded their
    own version as well, which appeared on her fourth album 
    <i>Afrodisiac</i>. Brandy changed some of the lyrics, singing
    like having a conversation. However, neither of the two was
    included in the album. A remix of "My Boo" was also produced,
    featuring guest vocals from Nelly; however, Keys' part was
    omitted.</p>
