      <p>"Pick Up the Pieces" is a 1974 song by the Average White
    Band from their album 
    <i>AWB</i>. It was the group's most successful song, and
    features one of the most recognizable grooves in funk music. It
    is essentially an instrumental, apart from the song's title
    being shouted at several points in the song.

chord in the funk idiom); afterwards in the theme 8 measures of Fm7
(F A-flat C E-flat), 2 measures of Bb7 (B-flat D F A-flat), 4

      <p>"Pick Up the Pieces" was released in the United Kingdom in
    July 1974 but failed to make an impression. When the album was
    released in the United States in October 1974, radio stations
    started to pick up on the song, and on 22 February 1975, it
    went to the top of the US singles chart and peaked at number
    five on the soul charts. After its US success the song charted
    in the UK and climbed to number six. "Pick Up the Pieces" also
    made it to number eleven on the US disco chart.</p>
