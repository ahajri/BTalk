      <p>"Kyrie" was a #1 hit song by the 1980s pop/rock band Mr.
    Mister, from their 1985 album 
    <i>Welcome to the Real World</i>. Released in late 1985, it hit
    the top spot on the Hot 100 charts in March 1986, where it was
    #1 for two weeks. It also hit the top spot on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Top Rock Tracks chart for one week, and was the
    band's only #1 single on this chart. In the UK the song peaked
    at #11 in April 1986.</p>
      <p>The words to "Kyrie" were written by lyricist John Lang who
    co-wrote the songs on all of Mr. Mister's albums. The music was
    composed by Richard Page and Steve George while on tour with
    Adam Ant.</p>
      <p>Kýrie, eléison means "Lord, have mercy" in Greek, and is a
    part of many liturgical rites in Eastern and Western
    Christianity. 
    <i>Kýrie, eléison; Christé, eléison; Kýrie, eléison</i>is a
    prayer that asks "Lord, have mercy; Christ, have mercy; Lord,
    have mercy". According to Page the entire song is, essentially,
    a prayer.</p>
      <p>There is a myth that singer Richard Page wrote this song
    while lying in a hospital bed following an unprovoked attack.
    John Lang has stated that he was the one who was attacked,
    three years before "Kyrie" was written, and that the incident
    has nothing to do with the song.</p>
      <p>The video for this song was directed by Nick Morris, and
    features the band in performance mixed with footage taken at
    the tail end of their Fall 1985 tour with Tina Turner.</p>
      <p>The single edit of the song ends with the a cappella phrase
    "Kýrie, eléison, down the road that I must travel", while the
    album version simply fades out.</p>
      <p>In 1993, Acapella Vocal Band, a traditional Southern gospel
    group, included a version of the song on their album 
    <i>U And Me And God Make 5 (Word)</i>. The cover turned into a
    hit on the Contemporary Christian Music charts of 1994, and the
    group later recorded a Spanish version of the song as well.</p>
      <p>In 2002, Mark Schultz, made a cover of the song on his Song
    Cinema CD.</p>
