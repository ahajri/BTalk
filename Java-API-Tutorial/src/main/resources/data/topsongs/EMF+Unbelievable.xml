      <p>"Unbelievable" is a song written and recorded by EMF. It was
    released as a single in the UK in 1990, peaking in the UK
    Singles Chart at number three on 25 November 1990. It was the
    32nd best-selling single of 1990 in the UK. In the United
    States, it hit number one on the Hot 100 on 20 July 1991.</p>
      <p>The song contains samples of US comedian Andrew Dice Clay
    throughout the track, including the loud exclamation of "oh!"
    at the start of each chorus along with the words "you're
    unbelievable" spoken at the end of the first chorus.</p>
      <p>A lesser known version of the song was released in Victoria,
    Australia. The version is largely identical to the mainstream
    release, except the role of Clay is played by VFL icon Phil
    Cleary, with some of Cleary's trademark 'grunts' adding value
    to the song.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, in the UK (where the band hailed from), the
    B-side of the single was a track called "EMF" which included
    the refrain: 
    <i>E! Ecstasy! M! Motherfucker, motherfucker! F! From us to
    you...</i>.</p>
      <p>"Unbelievable" has been covered by many other musical acts,
    including Tom Jones and "Weird Al" Yankovic (briefly in the
    polka medley "Polka Your Eyes Out"). It was sampled by rapper
    Esham, who took the chorus and riffs and made the song more
    sinister with heavy rap lyrics. It was also covered by the
    Christian rock band Thousand Foot Krutch on their debut album 
    <i>Set It Off</i>, but with markedly different lyrics. American
    grindcore band Anal Cunt covered "Unbelievable" on their 
    <i>Morbid Florist</i>EP in 1993, and by Ashley Amphlett and the
    Metroheads.</p>
      <p>Spin Magazine recommended a cover version of this song by an
    artist known Femme Fatality in its November 2006 issue.</p>
      <p>An altered version of the song, with the refrain "They're
    Crumbelievable", was used in a 2005 US television advertisement
    for Kraft Crumbles.</p>
      <p>Due to the amount of air time that "Unbelievable" has
    received since its release, it may be responsible for the most
    profanity ever heard over radio. The constant background vocal
    during the chorus saying "What the fuck was that?," which even
    appears in the lyrics in the CD booklet, was never edited. This
    is possibly due to the fact that the background vocal appears
    incoherently, and most people dismiss it as undecipherable
    lyrics.</p>
      <p>It was #31 on VH1's 
    <i>100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders</i>and #98 on VH1's 
    <i>100 Greatest Songs of the 90s</i>.</p>
