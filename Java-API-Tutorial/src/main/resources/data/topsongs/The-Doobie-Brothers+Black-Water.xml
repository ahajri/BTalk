      <p>"Black Water" is a song by the American music group The
    Doobie Brothers from the album 
    <i>What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits</i>. Released in 1974,
    it features Patrick Simmons on lead vocals.</p>
      <p>Introducing a bluegrass sound to traditional rock, "Black
    Water" hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 on 15 March 1975. The
    song was originally released in early 1974 as the B-side to
    "Another Park, Another Sunday" but ultimately became the more
    popular song.</p>
      <p>The song is characterized by the melodious a cappella
    section, with lyrics that are perhaps the most well-known in
    the entire song, which sing: "
    <i>I'd like to hear some funky Dixieland/Pretty mama, come and
    take me by the hand.</i>"</p>
