      <p>"The Promise of a New Day" is the second single (and
    lead-off track) from American artist Paula Abdul's album 
    <i>Spellbound</i>. The song was written by Peter Lord and V.
    Jeffrey Smith. The single was released to radio while the hit
    "Rush Rush" was still at the top of radio airplay and the pop
    charts.</p>
      <p>The song hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 on September 14,
    1991, becoming Abdul's sixth chart-topping single, and her last
    #1 hit to date.</p>
      <p>The video for the song was recorded in front of a green
    screen in Hawaii. However, since Abdul was unable to film the
    clip due to other commitments, she shot the necessary scenes
    elsewhere, which were then edited into the video.</p>
      <p>The video caused controversy when originally aired mainly
    because it appeared to make Abdul look thinner than she
    actually was. However, on Pop Up Video, VH1 (and Abdul in a
    filmed segment) secured that the clip had been edited in such a
    way as to make the dancers appear closer together.</p>
      <p>In that same episode, Abdul admitted that she fell in heels
    during filming of the dance sequences.</p>

      <p>The song was covered by American indie band Mirror Ball
    Associates for the album 
    <i>Covers Vol. 1</i>, which features Paul Durham (lead singer
    of Black Lab) on vocals.</p>
