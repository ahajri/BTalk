      <p>"Rags to Riches" is a 1953 popular song by Richard Adler and
    Jerry Ross. The best-known version of the song was recorded by
    Tony Bennett and reached #1 on the Billboard chart in 1953. In
    the same year, a version by David Whitfield reached #3 in the
    British charts. Later recordings by Sunny and the Sunliners
    (#45 in 1963) and Elvis Presley (#33 in 1971) also made the
    Billboard charts.</p>
      <p>The two themes that make up the main portion of the song and
    the tango-like bridge section were originally written by
    Charlie Chaplin as accompaniment to his movies. The themes tell
    a story of a magic elf who regained her youth by drinking three
    cups of enchanted gypsy blood. Similarly, the song 
    <i>"Smile"</i>which was also a hit in the early 1950s is based
    on a theme from Chaplin's 
    <i>Modern Times</i>.</p>
      <p>The song was used in the film, 
    <i>Goodfellas</i>at the beginning Where Henry Hill just closes
    the trunk of the car and says "As far back as I can remember, I
    always wanted to be a gangster".</p>
      <p>"Rags to Riches" provided the basis for an unusual moment
    late in Elvis's career. Near the end of a New Year's Eve
    concert on December 31, 1976/January 1, 1977, Elvis announced
    he would sing the song -- which his band evidently hadn't
    rehearsed and didn't know. Playing piano, and giving chord
    instructions to his surprised band members, Elvis delivered a
    passionate rendition, climaxing with a series of near-operatic
    high notes before the last word "you." The effort earned a loud
    ovation from the audience in Pittsburgh's Civic Arena. However,
    the moment would never be repeated; this was the only time
    Elvis sang the song in live performance. The moment was
    captured on a recording by an audience member that was later
    bootlegged.</p>
