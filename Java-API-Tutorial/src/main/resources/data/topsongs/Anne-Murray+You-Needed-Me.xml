      <p>"You Needed Me" is a song written by Randy Goodrum, who
    describes it as being about "unconditional undeserved love." It
    was a number one single in the United States in 1978 for
    Canadian singer Anne Murray. The song, included on her 1978
    album 
    <i>Let's Keep It That Way</i>, was also a top-five country
    single and won Song of the Year at the Academy of Country Music
    awards. The Anne Murray version was number one in Malaysia for
    ten weeks. Although the song reached number one on the
    Billboard Hot 100, it never topped the two 
    <i>Billboard</i>charts where Murray had the most success -
    Country and Adult Contemporary.</p>
      <p>In 1979, Kenny Rogers and Dottie West released a cover on
    their album 
    <i>Classics</i>.</p>
      <p>Anne Murray re-recorded the song with Shania Twain for
    Murray's 2007 album Anne Murray Duets: Friends &amp;
    Legends.</p>
      <p>The song was featured in an ongoing storyline on the CBS
    soap 
    <i>Guiding Light</i>in 1980-81, as a theme song for the
    characters Kelly Nelson and Morgan Richards.</p>
      <p>You Needed Me became the second single for Irish Boyband
    Boyzone from their album By Request. The single became number
    #1 on the UK Singles Chart, beating the debut solo single of
    Spice Girl Geri Halliwell, outselling her by just 700 copies.
    The song has received a Silver sales status certification for
    sales of over 200,000 copies in the UK.</p>
