      <p>"Coming Out of the Dark" is a single by American singer and
    songwriter Gloria Estefan. It was released in 1991 worldwide as
    the leading and first single of the album 
    <i>Into the Light</i>, becoming the singer’s third number one
    in the U.S.</p>
      <p>This is the first single released after Estefan's tragic
    accident—an 18-wheeler rammed her tour bus, nearly causing the
    singer's death—when her "Get on Your Feet Tour" was in
    progress. It is also the first song that Estefan performed
    publicly after recovering. The song is inspired by the
    near-fatal accident and also is dedicated to Emilio Estefan,
    Jr., Gloria’s husband, who was with her until this dark time
    ended for the Estefans and their fans.</p>
      <p>The song is a soft-pop song which includes the use of a
    choir. Among the voices in the choir are Gloria’s colleague,
    the Cuban singer Jon Secada, and the R&amp;B singer Betty
    Wright (both had participated in backing vocals on Gloria’s
    album, 
    <i>Cuts Both Ways</i>as well as 
    <i>Into the Light</i>.)</p>
      <p>Estefan also recorded the Spanish version of the song,
    called "Desde la Oscuridad". The song was released to
    Latin-American radio stations and the considerable airplay it
    received took the song to the Top Five of the Hot Latin Songs
    chart.</p>
      <p>These are the formats and track listings of major single
    releases of "Coming Out of the Dark".</p>
      <p>Europe CD maxi single ()</p>
      <p>Even though the song was a number one hit in the U.S. (and
    her last to date), the song didn’t have as much impact in the
    rest of the world. In Ireland, where Estefan had some high
    position songs, this single only reached the Top 20; and in UK
    reached the Top 40, a very low position in comparison to other
    singles.</p>
