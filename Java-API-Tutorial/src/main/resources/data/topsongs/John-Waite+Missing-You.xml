      <p>"Missing You" is a song by British musician John Waite and
    was included in the album 
    <i>No Brakes</i>. It peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot
    100 during the week of September 22, 1984, and number nine on
    the UK Singles Chart.</p>
      <p>John Waite re-recorded the song with country/bluegrass
    artist Alison Krauss which appeared on her album 
    <i>A Hundred Miles or More: A Collection</i>, and released it
    to country music radio in 2007. The re-recording peaked at #34
    on the Hot Country Songs chart. It was also featured in the
    popular 1980s inspired video game 
    <i>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</i>and the second episode of the
    TV series Miami Vice ("Heart of Darkness" - originally aired
    September 28, 1984).</p>
      <p>This song was also recorded by Tina Turner in 1996, and was
    released as the third single from the album 
    <i>Wildest Dreams</i>. When Waite's original version of
    "Missing You" topped Billboard's Hot 100 in late 1984, the song
    that it knocked out of a 3-week reign at the top was none other
    than Tina Turner's "What's Love Got to Do with It". Turner's
    version of Waite's "Missing You" hit #12 in the UK and #84 in
    the U.S.</p>
      <p>The single "Missing You" included an edited single version
    of the track, an alternative mix and certain formats also the
    European non-album track "The Difference Between Us", later
    featured on the U.S. edition of the 
    <i>Wildest Dreams</i>album.</p>
      <p>"Missing You" was recorded by American folk-pop musician
    David Wilcox for his 1994 album "Big Horizon."</p>
      <p>The song was also recorded by Evan Dando and Tom Morgan as a
    part of Triple J's Live at The Wireless.</p>
      <p>It was also recorded by country music duo Brooks &amp; Dunn
    in 1999 on their 
    <i>Tightrope</i>album; their version peaked at #15 on the
    country chart.</p>
      <p>Another cover came from Rod Stewart in 2006 on his album, 
    <i>Still the Same... Great Rock Classics of Our Time</i>.</p>
      <p>A cover has also been made by actor/musician Tyler Hilton,
    exclusively for the soundtrack of One Tree Hill.</p>
      <p>Declan Galbraith recorded a cover version on his album 
    <i>You and Me</i>.</p>
