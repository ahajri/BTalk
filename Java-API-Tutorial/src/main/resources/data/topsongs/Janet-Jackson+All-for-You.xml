      <p>"All for You" is a song by American R&amp;B and pop singer
    Janet Jackson from her seventh studio album, 
    <i>All for You</i>(2001). Released as the album's lead single
    in March 2001, the song went on to top the Hot 100 for seven
    weeks, and also reached the top five and the top ten of the
    majority of the charts. "All for You" remains Jackson's last
    Hot 100 number-one single so far.</p>
      <p>The song is based upon a sample from Change's 1980 song "The
    Glow of Love"—composed by Mauro Malavasi and David Romani, with
    lyrics by Wayne Garfield—, which featured lead vocals by Luther
    Vandross. It made history by being the first single ever to be
    added to every major format of radio on the day of its release.
    The song became Jackson's tenth number one on the Hot 100,
    staying there for seven weeks, in addition of topping the Hot
    R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Dance Club Play charts. It became
    the longest-running number-one single on the Hot 100 of 2001.
    To date it is Jackson's latest song to top the charts. The song
    was also an international success, reaching number one in
    Canada and charting inside the top ten of almost all European
    countries and the top five in Australia and New Zealand. The
    song won several music awards, including a 2002 Grammy Award
    for Best Dance Recording.</p>
      <p>Jackson performed the song on the All for You Tour and Rock
    Witchu Tour.</p>
      <p>"All for You" is set in common time with a key of G major.
    Jackson's vocal chords ranges between the tonal nodes of G
    <sub>3</sub>to E
    <sub>5</sub>. The song is in a moderate tempo of 112 beats per
    minute with the chord progression being set like
    Em–Am–D–Em–Am.</p>
      <p>The video, directed by Dave Meyers, takes place in a
    colorful two-dimensional world. Released in March 2001, it
    revolves around Jackson flirting with a man whom she first
    meets on the subway. Jackson and her dancers perform
    high-octane choreography throughout the video which also
    features a dance break containing samples of a few different
    songs: her sister Rebbie Jackson's 1984 song "Centipede",
    Jackson's own 1986 hit song "The Pleasure Principle", her 1998
    single "Go Deep", and Shannon's 1983 song "Let the Music Play".
    The video ends with Jackson spotting the same man near a
    nightclub, who smiles at her; she waves at him before turning
    to leave.</p>
      <p>The video was nominated for Video of the Year, Best Female
    Video, Best Dance Video, and Best Choreography at the 2001 MTV
    Video Music Awards. It appears on the DVD edition of 
    <i>All for You</i>—which also contains an exclusive live
    performance of the song from mtvICON—as well as the 2004 DVD 
    <i>From janet. to Damita Jo: The Videos</i>.</p>
