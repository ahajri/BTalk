      <p>"Hooked on a Feeling" is a 1968 pop song written by Mark
    James originally performed by B. J. Thomas. Featuring the sound
    of the electric sitar, the song reached number five in 1969 on
    the Billboard Hot 100. This then had two successful covers. In
    1971, Jonathan King produced his own version, adding 
    <i>ooka shaka</i>jungle chants similar to, but not exactly the
    same as, Johnny Preston's "Running Bear." King described it as
    "a reggae rhythm by male voices." His version was a Top 30 hit
    throughout Europe.</p>
      <p>In 1974 the Swedish pop group Blue Swede with Bj√∂rn Skifs as
    lead singer did a cover, with the "ooka shaka" introduction.
    Their version reached number one in the United States and was
    revived on the soundtrack in 1992. In 1975, this version was
    subject to some minor controversy when Wilson Bryan Key, in his
    book 
    <i>Subliminal Seduction</i>, claimed the words "ooka shaka" are
    changed to the phrase "who got sucked off" at 0:31 into the
    song.</p>
      <p>It was covered again in 1997 by David Hasselhoff (with a
    music video), which later in 2009 got a literal music video
    created by DASjr Productions,</p>
