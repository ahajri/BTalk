      <p>"You're the One That I Want" is a song written by John
    Farrar for the 1978 film version of the musical 
    <i>Grease</i>. It was performed by John Travolta and Olivia
    Newton-John.</p>
      <p>The single was a huge international hit, reaching no.1 in
    several countries. It was the first of two songs from the 
    <i>Grease</i>soundtrack to top the U.S. and UK pop charts. It
    reached #1 on the U.S. Hot 100 for one week in June 1978, where
    it sold over 2 million copies. It also topped the UK Singles
    Chart for nine weeks in the summer of 1978 and, as of 2008, is
    still the sixth best-selling single ever in the UK where it has
    sold over 1,975,000 copies. A re-released version of the single
    reached #4 in the UK in 1998, the twentieth anniversary of the
    film's debut.</p>
      <p>In 1993, Epic Records released a soundtrack album in the UK,
    
    <i>Grease - Original London Cast Recording</i>, and "You're the
    One That I Want" was recorded as a duet by Craig McLachlan and
    Deborah Gibson (Epic UK 659 522, released July 1993). In part
    due to a routine promotional push, this cover version scored
    big on the UK singles charts, peaking at number thirteen.</p>
