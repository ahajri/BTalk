      <p>"Bridge Over Troubled Water" is the title song of Simon
    &amp; Garfunkel's final album together, released January 26,
    1970, though it also appears on the live album "Simon &amp;
    Garfunkel, Live 1969." It reached number one on the Billboard
    Hot 100 chart on February 28, 1970, and stayed at the top of
    the chart for six weeks. "Bridge Over Troubled Water" also
    topped the adult contemporary chart in the U.S. for six
    weeks.</p>
      <p>This song's recording process exposed many of the underlying
    tensions that eventually led to the breakup of the duo after
    the album's completion. Most notably, Paul Simon has repeatedly
    expressed regret that he insisted that Art Garfunkel sing this
    song as a solo, as it focused attention on Garfunkel and
    relegated Simon to a backing position. Art Garfunkel initially
    did not want to sing lead vocal, feeling it was not right for
    him. "He felt I should have done it," Paul Simon revealed to 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>in 1972.</p>
      <p>Garfunkel said that the moment when he performed it in
    Madison Square Garden in 1972 was "almost biblical".</p>
      <p>In recent performances on the "Old Friends" tour, Simon and
    Garfunkel have taken turns singing alternate verses of the
    vocal.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Rolling Stone</i>named it number 47 on The 500 Greatest
    Songs of All Time.</p>
      <p>Simon wrote the song in the summer of 1969 while Garfunkel
    was filming 
    <i>Catch-22</i>in Europe.</p>
      <p>The duo have stated in interviews that, contrary to popular
    belief, the song was not inspired by either Connel Bridge or
    the bridge over the Atlantic at Seil. It was, in fact, the
    bridge over the Black Lynn burn in Oban near Tesco supermarket
    that gave them the inspiration to pen the song.</p>
      <p>The song originally had two verses and different lyrics.
    Simon specifically wrote it for Garfunkel and knew it would be
    a piano song. The chorus lyrics were partly inspired by Claude
    Jeter's line "I'll be your bridge over deep water if you trust
    in me," which Jeter sang with his group, the Swan Silvertones,
    in the 1958 song "Mary Don't You Weep".</p>
      <p>Garfunkel reportedly liked Simon's falsetto on the demo and
    suggested that Simon sing. He and producer Roy Halee also
    thought the song needed three verses and a 'bigger' sound
    towards the end. Simon agreed and penned the final verse,
    though he felt it was less than fully cohesive with the earlier
    verses.</p>
      <p>Garfunkel's first two attempts to record the vocal failed.
    The first two verses were finally recorded in New York with the
    final verse recorded first, in Los Angeles. Part of the song
    was first heard in public on November 30, 1969, when it was
    included in the soundtrack of a one-hour TV special by the duo
    aired by CBS; the music appeared in the background of a clip
    with John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King,
    Jr.</p>
      <p>Larry Knechtel spent four days working on the piano
    arrangement. Garfunkel came up with the intermediate piano
    chords between the verses while working with Knechtel.</p>
      <p>As the song ends, drums, strings and piano build in a
    crescendo to an extraordinary climax. The last note, on a
    violin, is a long, drawn out E-flat that lasts ten seconds.</p>
      <p>The single won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and
    Song of the Year in the Grammy Awards of 1971, with its album
    also winning several awards in the same year.</p>
      <p>A gospel-inspired cover version by Aretha Franklin, taken
    from her album 
    <i>Aretha Live at Fillmore West</i>, reached number one on the
    U.S. R&amp;B chart and number six on the pop chart.. and later
    won the Grammy Award for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance
    in the 1972 awards.</p>
      <p>Elvis Presley recorded it in Nashville on 5 June 1970 and it
    was released on the 1970 album "That's The Way It Is." He
    included it in his set list for his next engagement in Las
    Vegas which included the filming of the 1970 documentary "Elvis
    - That's The Way It Is" and was included in the original
    theatrical release (included version is from 11 August Dinner
    Show). During this summer season in Vegas Paul Simon attended
    one of the shows and after seeing Elvis perform the song he was
    reported to have said "That's it, we might as well all give up
    now." Presley continued to use this throughout his live
    performances including his final live appearance in
    Indianapolis on 26 June 1977. Another live performance was seen
    in the Golden Globe winning documentary "Elvis on Tour" filmed
    at the Greensboro Coliseum in Greensboro, North Carolina on 14
    April 1972.</p>
      <p>On the studio version Robert Matthew Watson wrote in his
    book "Heartbreak Hotel": "Presley's outstanding singing is not
    disguised. This is a fabulous version, burning with sincerity
    and power, and finding depths not revealed by the
    composers."</p>
      <p>In addition to Franklin's gospel version, Buck Owens and the
    Buckaroos also covered the song for the country music market. A
    departure from Owens' usual Bakersfield Sound, his version
    reached the top 10 of the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot Country Singles chart in March 1971.
    Another 1971 cover was by Shirley Bassey on her album Something
    Else.</p>
      <p>David Foster, Andrea Bocelli and Mary J. Blige performed the
    song on January 31, 2010 during the 52nd Grammy Awards
    ceremony, in the context of raising awareness for the victims
    of the Haiti earthquake. This version debuted at #75 on the
    Billboard Hot 100.</p>
      <p>The song was also performed by Michael W. Smith, Clay Aiken,
    Morten Harket, Josh Groban, and Brian McKnight.</p>
