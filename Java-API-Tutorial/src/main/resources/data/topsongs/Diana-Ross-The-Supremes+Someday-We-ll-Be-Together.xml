      <p>"Someday We'll Be Together" is a hit song made popular as
    the last of twelve number-one singles for Motown act Diana Ross
    &amp; the Supremes, released on October 14, 1969. It is noted
    for being the final Supremes song featuring Diana Ross, who
    left the group for a solo career in January 1970 and was
    replaced by Jean Terrell. Despite this distinction, "Someday
    We'll Be Together" was originally recorded as Ross' first solo
    single; hence, Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong do not sing on
    the recorded release.</p>
      <p>"Someday We'll Be Together" reached the number-one position
    on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart for one week. As it
    topped the American pop chart in the final 1969 issue of 
    <i>Billboard</i>magazine (dated December 27), the single was
    not only the final number-one in 12 chart-topping pop hits for
    The Supremes, but it also holds the distinction of being the
    final American number-one hit of the 1960s.</p>
      <p>The single also charted at number-one on the Billboard
    R&amp;B Singles for four weeks, from December 13, 1969 to
    January 3, 1970. "Someday We'll Be Together" therefore appeared
    in 
    <i>Billboard</i>as both the final R&amp;B number-one of the
    1960s and the first R&amp;B number-one of the 1970s.. It was
    both preceded and succeeded by other Motown singles: "Baby I'm
    For Real" by The Originals preceded "Someday", while The
    Jackson 5's "I Want You Back" followed it.</p>
      <p>The song was written by Johnny Bristol, Jackey Beavers, and
    Harvey Fuqua in 1961; and Bristol and Beavers recorded the song
    together as "Johnny &amp; Jackey" for the Tri-Phi label that
    same year. "Someday" was a moderate success in the Midwestern
    United States, but gained little notice in other venues.</p>
      <p>Tri-Phi was purchased by Motown Records in the mid-1960s.
    Fuqua, Bristol, and Beavers all joined Berry Gordy's by-then
    famous record company, and "Someday We'll Be Together" became
    part of Motown's Jobete publishing catalog. Beavers soon
    departed for Chess Records, although both Bristol and Fuqua
    stayed on as songwriters and producers for the label.</p>
      <p>In 1969, Bristol was preparing a cover version of "Someday
    We'll Be Together", to be recorded by Motown act Jr. Walker
    &amp; the All-Stars. Bristol had already recorded the
    instrumental track and the background vocals by Maxine Waters
    and Julia Waters when Berry Gordy happened upon the tracks and
    heard them. Gordy thought that "Someday" would be a perfect
    first solo single for Diana Ross, who was making her
    long-expected exit from the Supremes at the time, and had
    Bristol sequester Ross into the studio to record the song.</p>
      <p>Unable at first to get the vocal performance he desired from
    Diana Ross, Johnny Bristol decided to try something different:
    he would harmonize with Ross, helping her to get into the mood
    needed for the record. On the first take, the engineer
    accidentally recorded both Ross's vocal and Bristol's ad-libs.
    Bristol and arranger Wade Marcus liked the results, and Bristol
    had his vocal recorded alongside Ross' for the final version of
    the song. Bristol's ad-libs and words of encouragement to Ross
    can be heard in the background throughout the song.</p>
      <p>When Berry Gordy heard the completed song, he decided to
    release it as the final Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes song.
    Ross' first solo single instead became "Reach Out and Touch
    (Somebody's Hand)".</p>
      <p>While the explicit subject of the song was that of Ross
    comforting a long-distance lover, "Someday We'll Be Together"
    allowed for a number of other implications as well. Most
    obvious was the suggestion that "someday", Ross and her
    bandmates Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong would "be together"
    once again (although, ironically, neither Wilson nor Birdsong
    sing on the record). In concert, Ross would suggest that the
    repeated chorus of "someday...we'll be together" seemed to
    present a message of hope for such contemporary troubles as
    civil rights and the protests and demonstrations over
    Vietnam.</p>
      <p>"Someday We'll Be Together" was included on the final Diana
    Ross &amp; the Supremes album, 
    <i>Cream of the Crop</i>. The song was a number-one hit on both
    the Billboard Pop Singles chart and the Billboard R&amp;B
    Singles charts, and charted at number 13 in the United
    Kingdom's Top 50 chart.. "Someday's" b-side, "He's My Sunny
    Boy", was recorded by Ross, Wilson, and Birdsong for the 
    <i>Love Child</i>album in 1968; Smokey Robinson was writer and
    producer of the track.</p>
      <p>Bill Anderson and Jan Howard recorded a cover version for
    the country music market. Their version reached No. 4 on 
    <i>Billboard magazine'</i>s Hot Country Singles chart in the
    summer of 1970.</p>
      <p>Other cover versions included those by rock artist Vonda
    Shepard, Scottish pop singer Jimmy Somerville, orchestra leader
    Bert Kaempfert, and country singer Lorrie Morgan. [1]</p>
      <p>It was covered again 24 years after the original in the
    smash hit "If" from Janet Jackson's album 
    <i>janet..</i>It samples the signature guitar riff from this
    song.</p>
      <p>The girl group made their final live appearance on the CBS
    variety program 
    <i>The Ed Sullivan Show</i>with Diana Ross as lead singer on
    Sunday, December 21, 1969.</p>
      <p>Fittingly, "Someday We'll Be Together" was the final number
    at Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes' farewell concert on January
    14, 1970 at the Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas. After the
    completion of the show, Jean Terrell was presented onstage to
    the audience as Diana Ross' replacement, and "Diana Ross &amp;
    the Supremes" officially split apart, becoming the 
    <i>new</i>"The Supremes."</p>
      <p>Diana Ross reunited with Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong
    reunited in 1983, performing the single for 
    <i>Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever</i>television
    special.</p>
