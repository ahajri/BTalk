      <p>"Baby, I Love Your Way/Freebird Medley (Free Baby)" is the
    title of a 1988 single by the American dance-pop band Will To
    Power. The song combines elements of two previously recorded
    rock songs: "Baby, I Love Your Way", a #12 Hot 100 hit from
    1976 by the British-born singer Peter Frampton; and American
    Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd's song "Free Bird", which hit
    #19 on the Hot 100 chart in 1975. Will to Power's medley of
    these two songs had more of a synthesized dance beat (as
    opposed to the rock ballad-like nature of the two original
    songs), and it rose to #1 on the Hot 100 chart on December 3,
    1988, remaining there for one week. It also peaked at #2 on the
    
    <i>Billboard</i>adult contemporary chart.</p>
      <p>In March and April 2009, VH1 ran a countdown of the 
    <i>100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of the 80s</i>. Will to Power's
    "Baby, I Love Your Way/Freebird Medley" placed at #97 on the
    countdown despite the fact that the group had another Top 10
    hit, a cover version of the 1975 10cc hit "I'm Not in Love"
    (#7), in 1991.</p>
