      <p>"How Do U Want It" is a song of 2Pac featuring K-Ci and JoJo
    and was the third single from his album 
    <i>All Eyez on Me</i>. It was a Double A-side single to
    "California Love", and the tracks combined were credited as a
    #1 single on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in 1996. In the UK, the
    song peaked at #17.</p>
      <p>It samples Quincy Jones's "Body Heat" from his 1974 album 
    <i>Body Heat</i>
      </p>
      <p>The song includes a diss of noted gangsta rap critic C.
    Delores Tucker.</p>
      <p>There were three videos filmed for this song: two in the
    same set for the single in April 1996 directed by Ron Hightower
    and produced by Tracy D. Robinson. These two are distinguished
    by MPAA rating (one is certified adult material). The video
    portrays a wild sex party with jacuzzi, mechanical bull riding,
    cage dancing and pole stripping. All actors and actresses are
    dressed in renaissance-age costumes, though all clothes are
    removed for the nude clip. The limousine segment seen in the
    clean version is the same except no nudity. The third one is
    the concert version, mostly them performing on stage (not the
    House Of Blues live performance). There are cameo appearances
    by K-Ci &amp; Jojo both in the concert and studio segments. The
    adult-material video also features numerous porn stars,
    including Nina Hartley, Heather Hunter, and Angel Kelly.</p>
