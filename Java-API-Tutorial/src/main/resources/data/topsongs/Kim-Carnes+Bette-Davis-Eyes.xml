      <p>"Bette Davis Eyes" is a song made popular by American
    singer-songwriter, Kim Carnes.</p>
      <p>The song was written in 1974 by Donna Weiss and Jackie
    DeShannon. DeShannon recorded the song that same year on her
    album 
    <i>New Arrangement</i>. But it was not until 1981, when Kim
    Carnes recorded her version of the song, that it became a
    commercial success.</p>
      <p>The Kim Carnes recording of the song spent nine
    non-consecutive weeks on top of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100
    (interrupted for one week by the "Stars on 45 Medley"), and
    over eight million copies of the album on which the song
    appeared, 
    <i>Mistaken Identity</i>, were sold. The single went on to
    become the highest seller of the year and won the Grammy Awards
    for Song of the Year and Record of the Year. The song was also
    a number one hit in 31 countries, including Germany, Australia,
    Switzerland, Italy, Norway, Japan, and Brazil, but it achieved
    more moderate success in the UK Singles Chart, peaking at
    number ten. The music video was directed by Russell
    Mulcahy.</p>
      <p>According to producer Val Garay, the original demo of the
    tune that was brought to him sounded like "a Leon Russell
    track, with this beer-barrel polka piano part." Keyboardist
    Bill Cuomo came up with the signature synth riff which now
    defines Carnes' version. The song was recorded completely live
    in the studio on the first take.</p>
      <p>Bette Davis admitted to being a fan of the song and
    approached Carnes and the songwriters to thank them for making
    her "a part of modern times."</p>
      <p>The song was ranked at number 12 on 's list of the top 100
    songs in the first 50 years of the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot 100 chart.[1]</p>
