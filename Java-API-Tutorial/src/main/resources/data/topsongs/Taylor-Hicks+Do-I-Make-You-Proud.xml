      <p>"Do I Make You Proud" is a soul-pop song written for 
    <i>American Idol</i>season five winner Taylor Hicks by Tracy
    Ackerman, Andy Watkins, and Paul Wilson of the Absolute
    production team, and co-produced by Dave Way. The song was
    released as a single on June 13, 2006 from the Arista record
    label.</p>
      <p>The lyrics communicate a feeling of pride for one's
    accomplishments after struggling with and then finally
    achieving a long-term goal, all while retaining one's humility.
    This reflects Hicks' sudden career transformation from an
    independent musical artist to a celebrity.</p>
      <p>Hicks first performed the song on the finale of 
    <i>American Idol</i>'s fifth season, to which he received
    outstanding comments from all three judges. Simon Cowell
    correctly predicted that Hicks would win that year's 
    <i>American Idol</i>with the performance.</p>
      <p>Along with "Do I Make You Proud", it includes, as a B-side
    track, his cover of The Doobie Brothers's "Takin' It to the
    Streets". The 
    <i>American Idol</i>judges loved his rendition of "Takin' It to
    the Streets" – Randy Jackson said it was not his favorite song
    from Hicks, but he was trying to comprehend his dance moves
    onstage. Paula Abdul said that the song was great and loved the
    energy and dancing. Simon Cowell "loved the song" and said that
    "that's what it's all about — having fun and being memorable."
    Cowell also said it was the best performance of the night.</p>
      <p>Hicks' rendition of "Takin' It to the Streets" would become
    his first song to chart, peaking at number sixty-nine on the
    Hot 100, due to moderate sales of digital downloads only. The
    song was not released as Hicks's single, since "Do I Make You
    Proud" was to become his first single after he won the 
    <i>American Idol</i>competition.</p>
      <p>"Weird Al" Yankovic's 2006 album 
    <i>Straight Outta Lynwood</i>included a parody of "Do I Make
    You Proud", called "Do I Creep You Out". It is Yankovic's first
    parody of a singer from the Idol television series.</p>
      <p>The song was chosen to be the theme for the first ever Asian
    Idol. December 16, 2007, Hicks performed it live together with
    6 Asian Idol finalists in Jakarta, Indonesia.</p>
      <p>The song appears on the game Karaoke Revolution
    Presents:American Idol.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Billboard magazine</i>confirmed that "Do I Make You Proud"
    sold 190,000 physical singles and 38,000 digital downloads
    during its first week, prompting a number-one debut on the Hot
    100 for the issue dated July 1, 2006. It has been the 15th song
    out of over 900 number ones to debut at number one on the Hot
    100 chart; all American Idol winner's first singles (with the
    exception of Ruben Studdard, Jordin Sparks, David Cook and Kris
    Allen) have gone to number one on the Hot 100 chart. [2]. As of
    September 2009, "Do I Make You Proud" has sold 672,000 singles.
    [3]</p>
      <p>"Do I Make You Proud" remained number-one on the Billboard
    Hot 100 for one week, gradually declining until it left the
    chart after eight weeks, making it the first #1 single in the
    history of the US charts to fall off the charts in less than
    ten weeks. [4]</p>
