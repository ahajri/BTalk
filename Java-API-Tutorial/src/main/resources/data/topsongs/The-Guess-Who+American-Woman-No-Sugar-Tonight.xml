      <p>"American Woman" is the title track of Canadian band The
    Guess Who's 1970 album, 
    <i>American Woman</i>.</p>
      <p>The song's origins took the form of a live jam in Kitchener,
    Ontario. The group was rushing into the second set and began
    improvising a rhythm to liven up the crowd. Burton Cummings,
    the lead singer, began improvising lyrics to fit the music.</p>
      <p>The song's lyrics have been the matter of some debate, often
    interpreted as an attack on U.S. politics (especially the
    draft). Jim Kale, the group's bassist and the song's co-author,
    explained his take on the lyrics:</p>
      <p>Haley Eichhorn and Mackenzie De Rosa have claimed that the
    American woman referred to in the song is in fact the Statue of
    Liberty, furthering the anti-war theme.</p>
      <p>Another furtherance of the anti-war theme of the song stems
    from the fact that the Guess Who was a Canadian band, resulting
    in speculation that the line "I don't need your war machine"
    reveals the narrator to be a draft-dodger who had fled to
    Canada and is addressing a female United States armed-forces
    recruiter assigned to bring him back homeâ€”either in uniform or
    in shackles.</p>
      <p>As a single, the track spent three weeks at the top of the
    Billboard Hot 100 (where it was credited as a double sided hit,
    along with "No Sugar Tonight"), an unprecedented success for a
    Canadian band; at the time, it competed with singles such as
    The Jackson 5's "ABC" and the Beatles's "Let it Be".</p>
      <p>"American Woman" was voted Best Canadian Single of All Time
    by Magazine in both the 2000 and 2005 polls of readers, music
    industry professionals, and musicians throughout Canada.</p>
      <p>The song has been covered by many rock artists, including
    Lenny Kravitz, Krokus and The Butthole Surfers. It was also
    featured in Sam Mendes's movie 
    <i>American Beauty</i>. It has most recently been covered by
    former Guess Who members Cummings and Bachman in a blues rock
    style.</p>
      <p>Kravitz covered "American Woman" for the soundtrack of 
    <i>Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me</i>. It was later
    included in the 1999 re-issue of his 
    <i>5</i>album. The music video featured actress Heather Graham
    (who starred in 
    <i>The Spy Who Shagged Me</i>); the original political themes
    of the song were largely replaced by sex appeal.</p>
