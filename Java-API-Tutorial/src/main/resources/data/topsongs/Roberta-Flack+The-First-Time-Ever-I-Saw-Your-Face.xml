      <p>"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" is a 1957 folk song
    written by political singer/songwriter Ewan MacColl for Peggy
    Seeger, who was later to become his wife.</p>
      <p>MacColl wrote the song for Seeger, also a folk singer, after
    she asked him to pen a song for a play she was in. MacColl
    wrote the song and taught it to Seeger over the phone. The
    alternative version of the creation of this song is that
    MacColl was challenged by a friend to write a love song, with
    no politics. This song was the result.</p>
      <p>MacColl and Seeger included the song in their repertoire,
    when performing in folk clubs around Britain. During the 1960s,
    it was recorded by various folk singers (including a version as
    a solo guitar instrumental by Bert Jansch).</p>
      <p>The song entered the pop mainstream when it was released by
    Roberta Flack, in 1972. The Flack version was much slower than
    the original: an early solo recording by Seeger, for example,
    clocked in at two and a half minutes long, whereas Flack's is
    more than twice that length. It was subsequently covered by
    numerous other artists.</p>
      <p>MacColl was an absolute folk purist (for example he did not
    approve of English people singing Scottish folk songs, or vice
    versa) and reputedly hated almost all the recordings of the
    song, including Flack's. His daughter-in-law is quoted as
    saying:</p>
      <p>The song was popularized by Roberta Flack and became a
    breakout hit for the singer after it appeared in the film 
    <i>Play Misty for Me</i>. Though the song first appeared on
    Flack's 1969 album 
    <i>First Take</i>, Flack's recording of the song topped the
    Billboard Hot 100 and won the Grammy Award for Song of the Year
    three years later.</p>
      <p>Flack's slower, more sensual version was used by Clint
    Eastwood in his 1971 directorial debut 
    <i>Play Misty for Me</i>during a lovemaking scene. With the new
    exposure, Atlantic Records cut the song down to four minutes
    and released it to radio. It became an extremely successful
    single in the United States, hitting number 1 on the Billboard
    Hot 100 chart in the spring of 1972 and remaining there for six
    weeks; the song also spent six weeks at the top of Hot Adult
    Contemporary Tracks. It reached number fourteen on the UK
    Singles Chart. The success of "The First Time Ever I Saw Your
    Face" essentially launched Flack's career as a popular singer,
    and the single became one of her signature songs.</p>
      <p>Ewan MacColl himself made no secret of the fact that he
    disliked almost all of the cover versions of the song,
    referring to them collectively as "the Chamber of Horrors".</p>
      <p>"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" has been covered by
    numerous artists such as:Elvis Presley, Harry Belafonte, Lena

    Griffiths (member of the I-Threes). There is also a jazz
    rendition of the song by the Rachel Z trio, on their album of
    the same name.</p>
      <p>It has been used as a sample in Mastersafe's 1992 Breakbeat
    Hardcore release on Formation records In Your Eyes, Joanna
    Law's vocal appeared on Way Out West (musicians)'s The Gift and
    the Drum &amp; Bass song Dimensional Entity, released by Teebee
    and the Future Prophecies.</p>
      <p>Leona Lewis' version of the song has been used in a
    commercial in the United Kingdom for Sekonda watches.</p>
      <p>The song was used on a Oil of Olay commercial, in the early
    1980's.</p>
