      <p>"Wind Beneath My Wings" is the title of a pop song written
    by Larry Henley and Jeff Silbar. First recorded in 1982 by
    Roger Whittaker, then a country music hit for Gary Morris in
    1983, it was covered six years later by Bette Midler. Morris'
    original was a Top Ten country hit, and it won the Academy of
    Country Music and Country Music Association Song of the Year
    awards that year. Midler's was a Number One Billboard Hot 100
    hit which also won her a Grammy Award in 1990.</p>
      <p>"Wind Beneath My Wings" was recorded by American country
    music artist Gary Morris on his 1983 album 
    <i>Why Lady Why</i>and released as the album's third single.
    Morris' version reached the Top 10 of the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot Country Singles chart. It was named Song of
    the Year by both the Academy of Country Music and the Country
    Music Association.</p>
      <p>"Wind Beneath My Wings" was performed by Bette Midler for
    the soundtrack of the film 
    <i>Beaches</i>and became a U.S. number-one single. It was named
    Record of the Year and Song of the Year at the Grammy Awards of
    1990.</p>

      <p>Although the song has become primarily associated with Bette
    Midler, other versions of the song were released to the public
    years before Midler's. Roger Whittaker recorded the first
    version of the tune in 1982, releasing it in Canada on his
    "Wind Beneath My Wings" LP Tembo TMT-4321 and around the world
    on numerous other LPs, followed eventually by at least 26 CDs!
    This was later followed by Sheena Easton (on her album 
    <i>Madness, Money and Music</i>), though neither had a hit with
    the song. The song entered various U.S. charts the following
    year in versions by Gary Morris, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips
    (their version was released under the title "Hero"), and Lou
    Rawls (whose version was a top ten Adult Contemporary hit).</p>
      <p>On the episode of 
    <i>Boy Meets World</i>, Morgan, Cory's sister covers the song
    on the Season 6's "Better Average Than Cory" in October
    1998.</p>
