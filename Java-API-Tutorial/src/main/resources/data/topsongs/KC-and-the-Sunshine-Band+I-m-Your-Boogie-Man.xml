      <p>"I'm Your Boogie Man" is a popular song by KC and the
    Sunshine Band from their 1976 album 
    <i>Part 3</i>. Richard Finch told Songfacts that this was
    written about a DJ at a Miami, Florida radio station called
    Robert W. Walker, who was the first to give their hit single
    "Get Down Tonight" airplay. In 1977 the song reached the #1
    position on the Billboard Hot 100. The single reached #3
    R&amp;B, and #41 in the UK.</p>
      <p>The song was sampled in at least one preview for all four of
    the 
    <i>Scary Movie</i>films, as well as in the 2005 film 
    <i>Roll Bounce</i>, the 2007 film 
    <i>Superbad</i>and comic-to-film-adaptation 
    <i>Watchmen</i>.</p>
      <p>White Zombie originally recorded a cover of "I'm Your Boogie
    Man" for the 
    <i>The Crow: City of Angels Soundtrack</i>. However, since the
    song's release date, it has also appeared on Rob Zombie's
    greatest hits album 
    <i>Past, Present &amp; Future</i>and as a remixed version on
    the EP 
    <i>Supersexy Swingin' Sounds</i>. The song is another different
    music style for the band as they are fusing disco with heavy
    metal. The audio samples in the song where children are heard
    saying, "He's gonna get you! The Boogieman is coming!" are
    taken from the 1978 film 
    <i>Halloween</i>which would later be remade in 2007 by Rob
    Zombie.</p>
      <p>Although the song failed to chart, it earned the White
    Zombie their third and final Grammy nomination for Best Metal
    Performance in 1996.</p>
      <p>The music video features Rob Zombie singing along to the
    lyrics of the song. Rob's screen time is cut multiple times,
    flashing to select scenes from the film 
    <i>The Crow: City of Angels</i>.</p>
