      <p>"Reach Out I'll Be There" (also formatted as "Reach Out
    (I'll Be There)") is a 1966 hit song recorded by the Four Tops
    for the Motown label. Written and produced by Motown's main
    production team Holland-Dozier-Holland, the song is one of the
    most well-known Motown tunes of the 1960s and is today
    considered The Tops' signature song. It was the number one song
    on the R&amp;B charts for two weeks,. and on the Billboard Hot
    100 for two weeks, from September 24, 1966 to October 15. It
    replaced "Cherish" by The Association, and was itself replaced
    by "96 Tears" by Question Mark &amp; the Mysterians. Rolling
    Stone later ranked this version #206 on their list of the 500
    Greatest Songs of All Time. This version is also currently
    ranked as the 36th best song of all time, as well as the #3
    song of 1966, in an aggregation of critics' lists at
    acclaimedmusic.net.</p>
      <p>Lead singer Levi Stubbs delivers many of the lines in the
    song in a tone that straddles the line between singing and
    shouting, like he did in 1965's "I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie
    Honey Bunch)".</p>
      <p>This song differs markedly from the Four Tops' earlier
    efforts, due to the highly-contrasting shifts between minor and
    major, and also major and augmented chords. These contrasting
    tonal shades form the hook for which the song is so well known.
    The Four Tops would rely on this formula for several subsequent
    releases.</p>
      <p>The song is featured prominently in the final scene and the
    closing credits of the 1975 motion picture 
    <i>Cooley High</i>, a coming-of-age film starring Glynn Turman
    and Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs.</p>
      <p>PWL remixed the song in 1988. The remix was done by Phil
    Harding &amp; Ian Curnow. The 12" Remix runs 6:05 and the Radio
    Edit runs 3:10.</p>
      <p>Only weeks after the original release, Jamaican soul singer
    Derrick Harriott recorded and released a version of this pop
    soul hit on his own Crystal label in Kingston, Jamaica
    (reissued on 
    <i>Gaz Mayall's Top Ska Tunes</i>, Trojan 2004).</p>
      <p>Petula Clark recorded a version for her 1967 album 
    <i>Colour My World/Who Am I</i>.</p>
      <p>Merrilee Rush recorded what many consider a psychedelic
    version of the song in 1968. Titled simply "Reach Out", the
    single on the AGP label only made it to #79 on Billboard's Hot
    100 in December, 1968.</p>
      <p>Diana Ross scored a Top 40 remake of the Four Tops' classic
    taking it to number twenty-nine on the Hot 100 in 1971. It was
    the second release from Ross' third solo album, 
    <i>Surrender</i>, in just a year. Ross' version was produced by
    Nickolas Ashford &amp; Valerie Simpson, and was built around
    the same thematic basis that made Ross' 1970 remake of Marvin
    Gaye &amp; Tammi Terrell's "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" a
    success. Ross' cover is the best known and most successful
    cover of the song.</p>
      <p>Gloria Gaynor performed a disco version in 1975.</p>
      <p>Claude François recorded a version in French that was titled
    J'attendrai. The song has no relation to the 1939 French son
    also named J'attendrai.</p>
      <p>Famed drummer/producer/singer Narada Michael Walden
    performed a version of the tune on his 1983 album 
    <i>Looking at You, Looking at Me</i>, and it became a moderate
    R&amp;B hit.</p>
      <p>Punk rock band Snuff released a version of the song on their
    covers album 
    <i>Flibbidydibbidydob</i>.</p>
      <p>Elton John's 1989 single "Healing Hands" was directly
    inspired by this song. Its chorus starts with the line "And 
    <i>reach out</i>/ for her healing hands".</p>
      <p>Michael Bolton covered this song from his 1992 compilation
    album 
    <i>Timeless: The Classics</i>.</p>
      <p>The song inspired the 2003 film 
    <i>I'll Be There</i>featuring Charlotte Church.</p>
      <p>Michael McDonald also recorded a version for his album, 
    <i>Motown Two</i>(2004), the follow-up to his album 
    <i>Motown</i>(2003).</p>
      <p>Bill Cosby recorded a humorous version of the song for his
    album 
    <i>Bill Cosby Sings Hooray for the Salvation Army
    Band!</i>.</p>
      <p>Boyz II Men covered this song during a live medley on UK
    reality talent show 
    <i>The X Factor</i>in October 2007.</p>
      <p>Clare Teal also covered this song on her 2007 album 
    <i>Paradisi Carousel</i>.</p>
      <p>Meat Puppets were known to cover this song live in the early
    1980s.</p>
      <p>The Human League did an instrumental version of this song
    which was released on a demo compact cassette.</p>
      <p>Serbian 1980s group Oktobar 1864 covered this song in
    Serbian and had hit with it.</p>
      <p>Efrat Gosh covered this song in 2007 alongside local Israeli
    group "Red Band".</p>
      <p>Richie Kotzen covered this song from his 1994 studio album
    Mother Head's Family Reunion.</p>
      <p>The Swedish band Anywhen covered this song on their 1993
    studio album As We Know It.</p>
      <p>The song's introduction is sampled extensively throughout
    The Field's "Action".</p>
