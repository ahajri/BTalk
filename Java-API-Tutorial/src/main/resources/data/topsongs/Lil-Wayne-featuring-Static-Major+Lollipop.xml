      <p>"Lollipop" jumped 76 spots from number 85 to 9 on the March
    28, 2008 issue of the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot 100, becoming Lil' Wayne's highest charting
    single as a lead artist, along with being his first top ten hit

    Hot 100 on April 17, 2008, making it his highest charting

    2006. After one week, it slipped away from #1 on the Hot 100,
    but after a three-week rest the song returned, making it the
    song with the longest break in between peaking the Hot 100
    since Usher's "U Got It Bad."</p>
      <p>The week after the release, Wayne earned the biggest add
    week that a hip-hop artist received at Rhythm Crossover and the
    biggest for any artist at Urban Radio, including Beyoncé and.
    Mariah Carey. The song became the #1 most added and greatest
    gainer at both radio formats with a total of 138 adds.

    #36, and has so far peaked at #5. It is his first top ten on
    the Pop 100, where it has reached #2. Z100 added "Lollipop" as
    of April 17, 2008, making it his first add on the station as a
    solo artist. It returned to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the
    second time on the 22 of May 2008.</p>
      <p>The song has become a top ten success in Canada, so far
    peaking at #10 as of May 29, 2008, and his most successful song
    in the UK, where it has reached #26 on downloads alone. It
    reached #5 on the New Zealand charts and rose to #3 the next
    week.</p>

    replaces almost all the other sound with electric guitar, and
    features a hard rock version of the lyrics sung by the
    band.</p>
