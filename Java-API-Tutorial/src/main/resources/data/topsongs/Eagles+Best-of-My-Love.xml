      <p>"Best of My Love" is a song written by Don Henley, Glenn
    Frey and J.D. Souther. It was originally recorded by the Eagles
    (with Henley singing lead vocals), and included on their 1974
    album 
    <i>On the Border</i>. The band's first Billboard Hot 100 #1
    single in March of 1975, the song also topped the adult
    contemporary chart for one week in 1975. The shorter single
    version features minor edits throughout as well as a sloppy and
    abrupt cut of the final "Here in my heart, I give you the best
    of my love" line following the line "I guess that wasn't
    enough, whoa whoa, but", plus an earlier fade-out. The 45
    version, despite hitting number one, is not available in any CD
    format.</p>
      <p>The song has been covered by John Lees of Barclay James
    Harvest fame and released as a solo single in 1974; by reggae
    group Aswad on their 1990 album, 
    <i>Too Wicked</i>; By [Backstreet Boys On Never Gone But Didn't
    Make The Album] Rod Stewart on his 2006 album 
    <i>Still the Same... Great Rock Classics of Our Time</i>; and
    by Yvonne Elliman, who recorded a version for her 1975 album 
    <i>Rising Sun</i>. It was also recorded by Brooks &amp; Dunn
    for the album 
    <i>Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles</i>.</p>
