   <descr>
      <p>"End of the Road" is a 1992 number-one song recorded in June
    1992 by Boyz II Men for the Motown label. Written and produced
    by Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds, Antonio "L.A." Reid and Daryl
    Simmons. It is Boyz II Men's most successful single and
    replaced The Jackson 5's "I'll Be There" as Motown's most
    successful single. It was the last Motown single to reach #1 on
    the UK singles chart. The song is listed at #43 on 
    <i>Billboard's All Time Top 100'.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Originally recorded as a soundtrack song for the Eddie
    Murphy picture 
    <i>Boomerang</i>, the song (themed about a breakup where the
    man really doesn't want the woman to go) topped the charts from
    August 15 through November 7, 1992, setting a record for most
    weeks at number one with 13 weeks, beating Elvis Presley's
    11-week hold with "Hound Dog" / "Don't Be Cruel". Presley's
    record had stood 36 years.</p>
      <p>However, two weeks after "End of the Road" left the top
    spot, Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You" reached number
    one, and remained there 14 weeks, one week longer than "End of
    the Road." Boyz II Men's new record stood only 17 weeks. The
    group's next single ("I'll Make Love to You"), however, would
    tie Houston's record, and 1995's Boyz II Men/Mariah Carey
    collaboration "One Sweet Day" would break it, logging 16
    consecutive weeks.</p>
      <p>1993 Grammy Awards</p>
      <p>The song was covered by several artists, including Me First
    and the Gimme Gimmes on their album 
    <i>Take a Break</i>, We Are Scientists in concert, Gladys
    Knight on the live medley from her album 
    <i>Just for You</i>, and the Backstreet Boys during their
    concerts. An a capella version was re-recorded for Boyz II
    Men's 2007 album, 
    <i>Motown: A Journey Through Hitsville USA</i>. Marcela Morelo
    recorded an spanish version of the song in her 2009 album "Otro
    plan".</p>
      <p>During the series finale of the sitcom 
    <i>A Different World</i>, Whitley led everyone in singing "End
    of the Road" at hers and Dwayne's farewell party as they
    prepared to leave for Tokyo.</p>
