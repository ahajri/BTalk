      <p>"Chapel of Love" is a song written by Jeff Barry, Ellie
    Greenwich and Phil Spector, and made famous by The Dixie Cups
    in 1964, spending three weeks at number one on the Billboard
    Hot 100. There have also been many other versions of this song.
    This was also the debut release of the new Red Bird Records run
    by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller along with George Goldner.</p>
      <p>The song tells of the happiness and excitement the narrator
    feels on her wedding day, for she and her love are going to the
    "chapel of love," and "we'll never be lonely anymore."</p>
      <p>Previously recorded by The Ronettes and The Blossoms, the
    definitive version of the song was recorded by the Dixie Cups
    in 1964.</p>
      <p>Although "many have been quite annoyed by the sing-songy,
    cloying, childish quality", the song was ranked #279 on Rolling
    Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, being the
    group's only song on the list.</p>
      <p>This version was heard on the soundtrack to films ranging
    from 
    <i>Full Metal Jacket</i>to 
    <i>Father of the Bride</i>
      </p>
      <p>Bette Midler featured "Chapel of Love" on her 1972 debut
    album, 
    <i>The Divine Miss M</i>. The following year, Midler included
    her version as the B-side of her #40 Pop single, "Friends" (the
    single charted on the Billboard Hot 100 as a double
    A-side).</p>
      <p>The song was covered by the American pop group, The Beach
    Boys. It was released on their 1976 album, 
    <i>15 Big Ones</i>.</p>
      <p>This song was also covered by Elton John for the soundtrack
    of 
    <i>Four Weddings and a Funeral</i>.</p>
