      <p>"Run It!" is the debut single by American R&amp;B singer
    Chris Brown, featuring American rapper Juelz Santana in the
    remix. It was written by Santana, Sean Garrett and Scott
    Storch, and produced by the latter. It was released in 2005 and
    is Brown's first career single, off his debut album 
    <i>Chris Brown</i>. The song was a smash hit the United States,
    spending five consecutive weeks atop of the Billboard Hot 100,
    making Brown the second male act (Montell Jordan was the first
    in 1995) to have his debut single reach the spot. "Run It" also
    peaked number one in Australia and New Zealand and number two
    in the United Kingdom. It has been certified Platinum by the
    RIAA. A remixed version of "Run It!" appears on the album,
    featuring producer Jermaine Dupri and rapper Bow Wow.</p>
      <p>The music video, directed by Erik White, portrays a school
    dance inside a gym, where Brown meets a girl that he is
    suddenly attracted to and with whom he wants to dance. The
    video gives long dance sequences throughout. At the end, the
    security guards arrive, and the whole gym is evacuated.
    However, as soon as the guards find nobody there, they start
    dancing. Brown says the solo dances were freestyles. The video
    received nominations for Best New Artist and Viewer's Choice at
    the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards, but did not win either of
    these.</p>
      <p>In the United States "Run It" climbed to the top spot of the
    Billboard Hot 100. If also peaked at #1 in Austrailia and New
    Zealand, and reached the top 5, 10, and 20 on multiple other
    charts.</p>
