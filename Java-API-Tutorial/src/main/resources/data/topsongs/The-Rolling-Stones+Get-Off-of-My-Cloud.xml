      <p>"Get Off of My Cloud" is a song by the British rock band The
    Rolling Stones. It was written as a follow-up single to the
    successful "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction". The song topped the
    charts in the U.S. and the UK in the weeks following its
    release in November 1965.</p>
      <p>Written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, the song was
    recorded in early September 1965. The song is noted for its
    drum intro by Charlie Watts and twin guitars by Brian Jones and
    Keith Richards. The lyrics are defiant and rebellious, which
    was common practice for the Rolling Stones around that time;
    they were beginning to cultivate their infamous "bad boy"
    image. The Stones have said that the song is written as a
    reaction to their sudden popularity after the success of
    "Satisfaction". The song deals with their aversion to people's
    expectations of them.</p>
      <p>On the song, Richards said in 1971, "I never dug it as a
    record. The chorus was a nice idea, but we rushed it as the
    follow-up. We were in L.A., and it was time for another single.
    But how do you follow-up "Satisfaction"? Actually, what I
    wanted was to do it slow like a Lee Dorsey thing. We rocked it
    up. I thought it was one of Andrew Loog Oldham's worst
    productions." In a 1995 interview with 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>, Jagger said, "That was Keith's melody and
    my lyrics... It's a stop-bugging-me, post-teenage-alienation
    song. The grown-up world was a very ordered society in the
    early '60s, and I was coming out of it. America was even more
    ordered than anywhere else. I found it was a very restrictive
    society in thought and behavior and dress." In the 2003 book 
    <i>According to... The Rolling Stones</i>, Richards says: "'Get
    off of My Cloud' was basically a response to people knocking on
    our door asking us for the follow up to 'Satisfaction'... We
    thought, 'At last. We can sit back and maybe think about
    events.' Suddenly there's the knock at the door and of course
    what came out of that was 'Get off of My Cloud'."</p>
      <p>The song is in E major and is a variation on the Louie Louie
    riff: I-IV-V-IV, in this case E A B A.</p>
