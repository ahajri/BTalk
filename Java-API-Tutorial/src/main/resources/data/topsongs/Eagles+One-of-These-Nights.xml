      <p>"One of These Nights" is a song written by Don Henley and
    Glenn Frey and recorded by the American rock band Eagles. The
    title track from their 
    <i>One of These Nights</i>album, the song became their second
    single to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart and also helped
    propel the album to number one. The single version was
    shortened from the album version of the song, removing most of
    the song's intro and most of its fade-out, as well. Don Henley
    is lead vocalist on the verses, while Randy Meisner is lead
    vocalist on the refrain. It also features a guitar solo from
    Don Felder</p>
      <p>According to songwriter Glenn Frey, the song is about
    putting things off. "We've all said, 'one of these nights I'm
    gonna do something -- get that girl, make that money, find that
    house. We all have our dreams - a vision we hope will come true
    someday. When that 'someday' will come is up to each of
    us."</p>
      <p>The B-side, "Visions", features lead vocals by guitarist Don
    Felder, the only such Eagles song.</p>
