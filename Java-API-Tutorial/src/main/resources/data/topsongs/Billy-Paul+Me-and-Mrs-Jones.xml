      <p>"Me and Mrs. Jones" was written by Kenny Gamble and Leon
    Huff. It describes an extramarital affair between a man and his
    lover, Mrs. Jones. It has been recorded by Billy Paul and
    Michael Bublé, amongst others.</p>
      <p>"Me and Mrs. Jones" was a number-one single originally
    performed by soul singer Billy Paul, recorded and released in
    1972 on CBS Records' Epic imprint. The single, included on the
    album 
    <i>360 Degrees of Billy Paul</i>, was written by Kenny Gamble
    and Leon Huff. It describes an extramarital affair between a
    man and his lover, Mrs. Jones.</p>
      <p>The single became Paul's only number-one single on the
    Billboard Hot 100, peaking at that position for three weeks in
    December 1972. "Me and Mrs. Jones" also achieved this feat on
    Billboard's R&amp;B Singles chart, remaining at the number-one
    position for four weeks. It replaced "I Am Woman" by Helen
    Reddy and was replaced by Carly Simon's "You're So Vain".</p>
      <p>"Me and Mrs. Jones" is the second single to be released off 
    <i>Call Me Irresponsible</i>, Michael Bublé's third album. The
    song was a collaboration between Bublé's then girlfriend, Emily
    Blunt appears at the end of the song, singing minor back
    vocals.</p>
      <p>"Me and Mrs. Jones" has been well-received by critics, with
    Okayplayer even stating</p>
      <p>Additionally, the song was promoted by its performance at
    AOL Sessions. It has additionally been played at many of his
    concerts promoting his new album.</p>
      <p>A music video was made for the song. It consists mainly of
    Bublé standing in front of a window singing the song. Some
    scenes show a woman, representing "Mrs. Jones". Some shots from
    the promotional videos of "Lost" were used (particularly the
    ones where he lies on a white bed).</p>
      <p>Since it is believed that the single was cancelled soon
    after its release (there was little to no promotion for the
    song), "Me and Mrs. Jones" was not eligible to chart in any
    major music charts. However, it did chart in Switzerland.</p>
      <p>A cover of the song was also a hit for the 1970s group The
    Dramatics. Their version peaked at #47 on the pop charts and #4
    on the R&amp;B charts in 1974.</p>
      <p>It has also been covered by Ten Wedge, Roy Meriwether, Andy
    Abraham, George Huff, Sandra Bernhard, Head, Sarah Jane Morris,
    Michael Bublé, Hall &amp; Oates, the experimental rock band Sun
    City Girls, Amii Stewart and the soul band Tower of Power.</p>
      <p>A remake of this song was recorded by Freddie Jackson in
    1992. Coolio recorded his own version on his album 
    <i>Gangsta's Paradise</i>, entitled "A Thing Goin' On".</p>
      <p>A German version, entitled 
    <i>Sie lässt mich nicht mehr los</i>, was published in 2003 by
    the German soul singer Stefan Gwildis.</p>
      <p>Bobby Brown sampled the song in his first #1 solo hit,
    "Girlfriend", in 1986.</p>
