      <p>"Try Again" is a Grammy-nominated single by the late
    American singer Aaliyah. The song went #1 on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>charts, received favorable reviews, and won
    several prestigious awards.</p>
      <p>The song was written by Static Major and Tim Mosley
    (Timbaland) and produced by Tim Mosley. It was the second
    single released from the 
    <i>Romeo Must Die</i>soundtrack and written for the motion
    picture of the same name. The single was released to radio
    while "I Don't Wanna" was still at radio, "Try Again" had
    peaked by the time "I Don't Wanna" was phasing out. "Try Again"
    was one of her most successful songs on both the American
    charts and the international charts. It was the first song ever
    to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100 based solely on
    the strength of its radio airplay.</p>
      <p>The song was listed 10th on 
    <i>The Village Voice</i>'s 2000 Pazz &amp; Jop critics' poll.

      <p>In 2003 German metal band Knorkator covered "Try Again" for
    their album 
    <i>Ich hasse Musik</i>, turning the piece into a crushing
    orchestral industrial metal piece.</p>
      <p>In December 2009, 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>magazine listed the song 86th on their list
    of the 100 Best Songs of the Decade. On 
    <i>Billboard</i>'s hottest records of the 2000s list, the song
    placed 98th.</p>
      <p>While promoting the movie 
    <i>Romeo Must Die</i>and the soundtrack of the film, Aaliyah
    performed this song on 
    <i>The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</i>, 
    <i>The Rosie O'Donnell Show</i>, 
    <i>Top of the Pops</i>, MTV's 
    <i>Romeo Must Die</i>special and 
    <i>Total Request Live</i>.</p>
      <p>The music video was filmed at Hollywood Center Studios in
    early March 2000. It begins with Jet Li entering a hall of
    mirrors and Aaliyah stepping in, wearing a revealing low-cut
    bra and tight low-rise leather pants. Timbaland is also shown.
    The making of the video and the video itself was featured on
    the 
    <i>Romeo Must Die</i>DVD. The video was directed by Wayne
    Isham, with Fatima Robinson creating the choreography. The
    "Hall of Mirrors" room was inspired by Bruce Lee's 
    <i>Enter the Dragon</i>. The video placed 7th on BET's year-end
    special 
    <i>Notarized: Top 100 Videos of 2000</i>and ranks 46th on
    Channel Max's Top 100 Sexiest Women.</p>
