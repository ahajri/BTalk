      <p>"Philadelphia Freedom" is a song released by Elton John (as
    "Elton John Band") as a single in 1975. The song was one of
    John's numerous number-one U.S. hit singles during the early
    and mid-1970s, which saw his recordings dominating the charts.
    The song was written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin as a
    favour to Elton's friend, tennis star Billie Jean King. King
    was part of the Philadelphia Freedoms tennis team. The song
    features orchestral arrangements by Gene Page.</p>
      <p>This song plays in Philadelphia's Franklin Institute Imax
    Theater before every show to express the city's love for
    freedom and impact on shaping the country.</p>
