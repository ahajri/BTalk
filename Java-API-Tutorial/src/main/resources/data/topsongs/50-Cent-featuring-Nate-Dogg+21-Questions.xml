      <p>"21 Questions" is a song performed by rapper 50 Cent. Nate
    Dogg, who gives additional vocals, is featured, but not
    credited, on the chorus and outro. The song was written by 50
    Cent, K. Risto, J. Cameron, and V. Cameron for 50 Cent's
    commercial debut album 
    <i>Get Rich or Die Tryin'</i>(2003). Released in 2003 as the
    album's second single, it became his second number one song in
    the United States after "In Da Club". It reached number six in
    the UK Singles Chart while "In Da Club" was at #23, giving him
    the rare feat of having two singles in the Top 30 at the same
    time. The track was produced by Dirty Swift and Bruce Waynne of
    Midi Mafia and samples elements from Barry White's "It's Only
    Love Doing Its Thing". R&amp;B singer Lil' Mo created the
    answer-back remix titled "21 Answers". Her version received
    decent airplay, and was often merged together with 50 Cent's
    version for club play. While the title of the song is "21
    Questions," 50 Cent actually asks 22 questions in the duration
    of the song.</p>
      <p>When producer Dr. Dre worked with 50 Cent on his debut
    album, he stated that he did not want the song on the album.
    According to 50 Cent, "Dre was, like, 'How you goin' to be
    gangsta this and that and then put this sappy love song on?'"
    50 Cent responded saying, "I'm two people. I've always had to
    be two people since I was a kid, to get by. To me that's not
    diversity, it's necessity."</p>
      <p>The music video was directed by Damon Johnson, Dr. Dre and
    Phillip Atwell in March 2003. It depicts 50 Cent arrested and
    confined to prison, where he tries to keep in touch with his
    girlfriend, played by Meagan Good. In prison, he is constantly
    harangued by rival inmate, Tyson Beckford. The video ends with
    an alternate version of the beginning, showing 50 Cent and his
    girlfriend watching from their home as the police arrest
    Beckford instead of 50 Cent. The video has cameo appearances by
    G-Unit and Nate Dogg, who sings the chorus and the outro. The
    video concept can also be originated from Nate Dogg's "Never
    Leave Me Alone".</p>
      <p>On April 15, 2003, the video debuted on MTV's 
    <i>Total Request Live</i>at number six, reached number one two
    days later, and stayed on the chart for fifty days. It also
    reached number two on the 
    <i>MuchMusic</i>video charts.</p>
      <p>A remix was released which featured American R&amp;B singer
    Monica.</p>
