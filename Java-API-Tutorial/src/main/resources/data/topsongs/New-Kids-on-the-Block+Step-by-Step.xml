      <p>"Step by Step" was the biggest selling single from New Kids
    on the Block. Written by Maurice Starr, it was a huge worldwide
    hit selling over 6.5 million copies worldwide making it one of
    the biggest selling singles of 1990. It was the first single
    from the album of the same name, it was released on the 30th of
    June 1990. The song spent three weeks at #1 on the U.S.
    Billboard Hot 100 and was eventually certified platinum, it
    also spent two weeks at #1 in the Canadian Singles Chart, in
    total "Step by Step" spent five weeks at #1 in the North
    American charts. It also peaked at #2 on the UK Singles Chart
    and was also top 10 hits in the Australian, French, German,
    Irish and Norweigan charts. "Step by Step" was initially not
    meant to be recorded by the New Kids on the Block but was meant
    for one of Maurice Starr's other groups, but once the New Kids
    heard the song they insisted on making it a record for
    themselves, which it thus did and became their biggest selling
    single. It is also one of their signature songs.</p>
