      <p>"Tossin' and Turnin'" is a song written by Ritchie Adams and
    Malou Rene, and originally recorded by Bobby Lewis. The record
    reached number one on both the Billboard Hot 100 on July 10,
    1961, and R&amp;B chart, , and has since become a standard on
    oldies compilations. It was named Billboard's number-one single
    for 1961, after spending seven consecutive weeks at the top. It
    was featured on the soundtrack for the 1978 film, 
    <i>Animal House</i>.</p>
      <p>On the original hit single version, the track begins with
    Lewis singing "I couldn't sleep at all last night," and it
    appears this way on most oldies compilations. However, on some
    releases the song has a prelude, where Lewis sings
    "Baby...Baby...you did something to me," followed by a musical
    cue into the first verse. Lewis usually includes this prelude
    when he performs the song live.</p>
      <p>The song was covered by folk singer Steve Goodman, Kiss
    drummer Peter Criss (on his 1978 solo album entitled 
    <i>Peter Criss</i>), and polka star Jimmy Sturr.</p>
      <p>In 2008, 
    <i>Billboard</i>magazine ranked the song as the 27th biggest
    song of all time that charted on the Billboard Hot 100,
    commemorating the 50th anniversary of the chart.[1]</p>
