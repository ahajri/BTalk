      <p>"Kiss" is a 1986 song by Prince and The Revolution, from the
    album 
    <i>Parade</i>. "Kiss" started as a short acoustic demo, about a
    minute in length, with one verse and the chorus. Prince gave
    the song to the funk band Mazarati for their debut album.
    Mazarati and producer David Z. drastically reworked the song,
    giving it its stripped-down minimalist sound. When Mazarati
    delivered the song to Prince, he was amazed at their work and
    decided to take back the song for himself. He replaced their
    lead vocal, added the guitar break in the chorus and edited the
    song to its present form.</p>
      <p>Mazarati were credited for their backing vocals, which
    Prince left intact. He added the song at the last minute to 
    <i>Parade</i>. Despite Warner Bros. not wanting to release it
    as a single, "Kiss" became Prince's third number-one U.S. hit
    following 1984's highly successful "When Doves Cry" and "Let's
    Go Crazy". It was also a big hit across the Atlantic, reaching
    #6 on the UK Singles Chart. The song won Prince another Grammy
    Award for Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group, and
    was nominated for Best R&amp;B Song. The song has become a
    staple at Prince's concerts and is usually sung partially by
    the audience.</p>
      <p>The 12" single of the song is an extension of the album
    track. The extended section is based on the funky guitar line
    and contains much fuller instrumentation than the main track,
    including bass, keys and horns. New lyrics are present from
    Prince with Jill Jones that end with a humorous dialogue
    between a wife and her husband watching Prince on television.
    The B-side of "Kiss" was "♥ or $" ("Love or Money"), sung in a
    processed, higher-pitched vocal, which Prince would later use
    for his 
    <i>Camille</i>material. The song relates to the theme in 
    <i>Under the Cherry Moon</i>, and a bit of the song was heard
    in the film, as was a bit of the extended version of "Kiss".
    The extended "Kiss" was included on 2006's 
    <i>Ultimate</i>; "♥ or $" was recently re-released as a digital
    B-side on iTunes.</p>
      <p>
         <i>New Musical Express</i>ranked the song #4 in their list of
    The 150 Greatest Singles of All Time.</p>
