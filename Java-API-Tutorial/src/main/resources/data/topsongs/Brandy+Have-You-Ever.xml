      <p>"Have You Ever?" is a pop ballad written by Diane Warren for
    Brandy's second studio album, 
    <i>Never Say Never</i>(1998). It was produced by David Foster
    and released as the album's third single during the fourth
    quarter of 1998 (see 1998 in music). The single became Brandy's
    second song to reach the top position on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot 100. The ballad also reached number one in
    New Zealand, peaked within the top ten in Australia, and the
    top 30 in Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>"That was the first time I had been in the studio with a
    producer like David Foster," Brandy said about recording in a
    2005 interview. "My voice wasn't as developed as it is now and
    the song required what producers call â€˜money notes' - the kind
    that get you a No. 1 on the charts! I was really nervous but it
    all worked just fine."</p>
      <p>These are the formats and track listings of major
    single-releases of "Have You Ever?."</p>
