      <p>"Peppermint Twist" is a song written by Joey Dee and Henry
    Glover, recorded and released by Joey Dee and the Starliters in
    1961. Capitalizing on the Twist dance craze and the nightclub
    in which Dee performed ("The Peppermint Lounge"), the song hit
    number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in early 1962. The
    original recording of the song was considered too long for
    release on a 45 rpm single, so it was split into two parts. It
    was this first part, "Peppermint Twist (Part 1)" which became
    the No. 1 hit; the mostly instrumental second half of the
    recording is rarely heard today.</p>
      <p>"Peppermint Twist" replaced Chubby Checker's "The Twist,"
    the song that sparked the Twist craze, at the number one
    position. A version by Bill Haley &amp; His Comets was recorded
    for Armed Forces Radio in 1962, but was not released until
    2000.</p>
      <p>The lead singer in the Starliters' version is David Brigati,
    whose brother, Eddie Brigati, was a singer for the 60's hit pop
    group, the (Young) Rascals.</p>
      <p>The song was later covered by Dee Dee Sharp, the classic
    rock band Sweet, et al.</p>
      <p>The Joey Dee and the Starliters recording features in the
    film "American Graffiti" (1973).</p>
