      <p>"Cracklin' Rosie" is a 1970 song written and performed by
    Neil Diamond in 1970, from his album 
    <i>Tap Root Manuscript</i>. This was Neil Diamond's first
    American #1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in October 1970, and
    his third to sell a million copies. It become Diamond's
    breakthrough single on the UK Singles Chart in 1970, reaching
    #3 in December 1970. It also reached #2 on the Australian
    Singles Chart.</p>
      <p>Married to a catchy and dynamic melody and arrangement, the
    lyrics suggested to some a devotion to a woman of the
    night:</p>
      <p>But in actuality, Cracklin' Rosie is a type of wine drunk by
    a native Canadian tribe that Diamond had visited in Canada.
    Apparently the tribe had more men than women. Cracklin' Rosie
    was the nickname they used for their homemade alcoholic brew,
    which the single men, who did not have dates, would sit around
    the fire and drink together.</p>
      <p>In terms of wine itself, the title is seen to refer to
    (misspelled) rosé wine which is "crackling" - a U.S. term
    equivalent to pétillant or lightly sparkling. A Crackling Rosé
    is produced by, for example, Paul Masson Vineyards and
    Beckett's Flat.</p>
      <p>The single version released by Uni Records in 1970 was in
    mono, while the album version from 
    <i>Tap Root Manuscript</i>was in stereo.</p>
      <p>"Cracklin' Rosie" is heard on the Perth based radio station
    882 6pr as part of a weather segment.</p>
