      <p>"Little Star" is the name of a song recorded by The
    Elegants. Members Vito Picone and Arthur Venosa co-wrote the
    lyrics. The music was adapted from "Twinkle Twinkle Little
    Star." When released as a single in 1958, it topped both the
    R&amp;B Best Sellers list and the Billboard Hot 100; however,
    it was the only song that The Elegants ever charted. Reportedly
    the Elegants refused to pay payola to a prominent New York disc
    Jockey. This led to their getting little air play of their
    follow up recordings.</p>
      <p>"Little Star" remains one of the most popular examples of
    doo wop music. Other artists to record this song include Dion,
    Randy and the Rainbows, The Slades, Vera Lynn, Linda Scott and
    Bobby Vee.</p>
