      <p>"I'll Get By (As Long as I Have You)" is a popular song with
    music by Fred E. Ahlert and lyrics by Roy Turk. It was
    published in 1928. The song was revived to even greater success
    in 1944, when the 1940 recording by Harry James (Dick Haymes
    vocal) was re-released (Billboard #1). The Ink Spots version
    was also popular in 1944, reaching the retail top ten.</p>
      <p>Later covers include: UK singer, Maureen Evans in 1958; Jack
    Jones for his 1965 album 
    <i>Dear Heart</i>and Sun Ra in 1973 and 1977 in his posthumous
    album "Some Blues But Not The Kind Thats Blue".</p>
      <p>This song was interpreted by Marilyn Monroe during one of
    her lessons in the Actors'studio. She made the audience cry. A
    proof that she really was a good actress.</p>
      <p>This song is not to be confused with "I'll Get By," the 1992
    hit ballad by Eddie Money.</p>
