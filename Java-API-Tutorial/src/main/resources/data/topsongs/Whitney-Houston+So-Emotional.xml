      <p>"So Emotional" is a song recorded by American pop/ R&amp;B
    singer Whitney Houston. The song was the third single from her
    second album 
    <i>Whitney</i>, and was released on November 12, 1987.</p>
      <p>"So Emotional" was written by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly
    , who also penned Madonna's "Like a Virgin", Cyndi Lauper's
    "True Colors", Heart's "Alone" (all also previous #1 songs),
    The Bangles "Eternal Flame" (another #1 song) and Linda
    Ronstadt's "How Do I Make You". The song centers on Houston
    loving being in love, singing "
    <i>I get so emotional baby / Every time I think of you / I get
    so emotional / Ain't it shocking what love can do</i>".</p>
      <p>The music video for "So Emotional" (directed by Wayne Isham)
    features Houston on tour and preparing for the night's concert.
    Footage is from the concert she performed at Stabler Arena in
    Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p>At this time Houston already had a string of five
    consecutive number-one hits on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. "So
    Emotional" went to the #1 position as well, giving her six
    consecutive number-one singles; putting her in a three-way tie
    with The Beatles and The Bee Gees. It became the first
    number-one of 1988, eventually receiving gold certification.
    The single remained in the Top 40 for fourteen weeks, and also
    reached number one on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play chart."So
    Emotional" was ranked sixth on The Billboard Hot 100 year-end
    charts (1988).</p>
      <p>In the United Kingdom the song was remixed by Shep Pettibone
    when released as a single and peaked at #5 in the UK Singles
    Chart in November 1987, remaining in the chart for 11 weeks.
    Elsewhere the single performed moderately well reaching
    twenty-one in France, twenty-six in Australia and thirty in
    Switzerland.</p>
      <p>In a 1988 episode of 
    <i>Kids Incorporated</i>called "The Picks Up", "So Emotional"
    was sung by Stacy Ferguson, who would later be a member of Wild
    Orchid and, as Fergie, the Black Eyed Peas.</p>
      <p>The song was used in the 1993 "The Tangled Web" episode of 
    <i>Melrose Place</i>.</p>
