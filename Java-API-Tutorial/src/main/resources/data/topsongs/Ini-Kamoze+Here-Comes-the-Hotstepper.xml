      <p>"Here Comes the Hotstepper" is a dancehall song by musician
    Ini Kamoze, co-written with Richard Winsland and recorded in
    1994. It extrapolates the well-known "na na na na na..." chorus
    from the song "Land of a Thousand Dances" by Cannibal and the
    Headhunters, later covered by Wilson Pickett. To date it is
    Kamoze's only US number-one hit. It also made the UK Top 5,
    peaking at number 4.</p>
      <p>The song was particularly popular in fashion shows of the
    1990s. It was also featured in 
    <i>Prêt-à-Porter</i>and a music video with footage from the
    film was released and included on the U.S. VHS release of the
    movie.</p>
      <p>"Here Comes the Hotstepper" samples various tracks.</p>
