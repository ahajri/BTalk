      <p>"Footloose" is a single by Kenny Loggins which spent three
    weeks at number one, March 31—April 14, 1984 on the U.S.
    Billboard Hot 100, and was the first of two number-one hits
    from the motion picture, 
    <i>Footloose</i>. The music video features several scenes from
    the film, in particularly the warehouse where Kevin Bacon's
    character performs an unorchestrated dance routine (which was
    actually performed to a different song in the film itself). The
    lyrics describe a young man who can't stop dancing and he
    encourages others to do the same: 'Cut Footloose' as the chorus
    suggests.</p>
      <p>The song was very well received, and is one of the most
    recognizable song recorded by Loggins. When the American Film
    Institute released its 
    <i>AFI's 100 Years…100 Songs</i>, "Footloose" reached the 96th
    position.</p>
