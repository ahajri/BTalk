      <p>"Everybody Wants to Rule the World" is a song by the British
    pop/rock band Tears for Fears. It was the band's ninth single
    release in the United Kingdom (the third from their second LP: 
    <i>Songs from the Big Chair</i>) and seventh UK Top 40 chart
    hit, peaking at number two in April 1985. In the U.S., it was
    the lead single from the album and gave the band their first
    Hot 100 number-one hit on June 8, 1985, remaining there for two
    weeks. It also reached number-one on both the Hot Dance
    Music/Club Play and Hot Dance Singles Sales charts in the U.S.
    The song has since become the pinnacle of Tears for Fears'
    chart success, its endurance allowing it to accumulate over two
    million radio broadcasts by 1994, according to BMI.</p>
      <p>In 1986, the song won "Best Single" at the Brit Awards.
    Orzabal would also argue the song deserved to win the Ivor
    Novello International Hit of the Year award, claiming that the
    winner - "19" by Paul Hardcastle - wasn't actually a song; it
    was just a dialogue collage.</p>
      <p>Ironically, considering the song's overwhelming success,
    "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" was somewhat of an
    afterthought during the recording of 
    <i>Songs from the Big Chair</i>. According to Roland Orzabal,
    he initially regarded the song as a lightweight that would not
    fit with the rest of the album. It was producer Chris Hughes
    who convinced him to try recording it, in a calculated effort
    to cross over into American chart success. Orzabal would later
    reveal in a radio interview that the beat from the song was
    "borrowed" from another UK Top 40 chart hit: "Waterfront", by
    Simple Minds.</p>
      <p>As was the case with the three hit singles from Tears for
    Fears' debut LP 
    <i>The Hurting</i>, the song featured bassist Curt Smith on
    lead vocals.</p>
      <p>For such a popular song, "Everybody Wants to Rule the World"
    has seen relatively few remixes. Extended, instrumental, and
    "urban mix" versions were done by producer Chris Hughes for
    inclusion on the single's various 12" releases. The only other
    remix of note was one done by electronica act The Chosen Few,
    included on the 2004 reissue of the greatest hits compilation 
    <i>Tears Roll Down (Greatest Hits 82-92)</i>. No official radio
    edits or alternate 7" versions of the song have been issued. A
    version labeled as the 7" version is included on the 2006
    remaster of "Songs from the Big Chair", but is no different
    than the album version apart from a shorter intro.</p>
      <p>The song was later partially re-recorded with a new lyric
    and released as "Everybody Wants to Run the World" for the 1986
    Sport Aid fund-raising campaign, once again reaching the UK Top
    5 in the process.</p>
      <p>"Pharaohs" is an instrumental that served as the B-side to
    the "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" single. The only voice
    heard is a recording of a BBC Radio announcer reading the
    Shipping Forecast for the sea lanes around the United Kingdom.
    The title of the song is a play on the word "Faroes", one of
    the places referenced in the forecast. This is one of the few
    songs in the Tears for Fears catalogue on which founding member
    Curt Smith shares a writing credit. The song has since been
    included in the B-sides and rarities collection 
    <i>Saturnine Martial &amp; Lunatic</i>as well as the remastered
    and deluxe edition reissues of 
    <i>Songs from the Big Chair</i>. A remix by British electronica
    act Groove Armada is included on their 2000 compilation album 
    <i>Back to Mine</i>.</p>
      <p>The promotional clip for "Everybody Wants to Rule the
    World", filmed in early 1985, was the third Tears for Fears
    clip directed by famed music video producer Nigel Dick. It
    features Curt Smith driving an antique Austin-Healey 3000
    sports car around various Southern California locales,
    including Salton Sea and Cabazon. Interspersed with these clips
    are shots of the full band performing the song in a London
    studio. Along with the clip for "Shout", the "Everybody Wants
    to Rule the World" video had a big hand in helping break Tears
    for Fears in America, due to its heavy amount of play on music
    video pioneer MTV.</p>
      <p>The single was released on a wide variety of formats in the
    UK, including a standard 7", a 7" double pack, two separate 12"
    versions, and a 10" single.</p>
      <p>Tears for Fears bassist Curt Smith included a solo acoustic
    version of the song on his 2000 EP 
    <i>Aeroplane</i>.</p>
      <p>In addition, "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" has been
    covered by the following artists:</p>
      <p>Additionally, the dark cabaret duo The Dresden Dolls insert
    a musical quoatation of it, with different but similar lyrics,
    in their song "My Alcoholic Friends" from their 2006 album 
    <i>Yes, Virginia...</i>.</p>
      <p>A unique extended edit of the song was featured at the end
    of the 1985 film 
    <i>Real Genius</i>. It has since been included on a number of
    other film soundtracks, including:</p>
      <p>The song appears in the initial trailer for the blockbuster
    1996 film 
    <i>Independence Day</i>, but was dropped from the final
    soundtrack in favor of "It's the End of the World as We Know It
    (And I Feel Fine)" by the band R.E.M.. It can also be heard in
    the film 
    <i>Watchmen</i>as a Musak version without vocals, in a scene
    featuring billionaire/philanthropist Adrian Veidt, formerly the
    superhero Ozymandias. The song was also used during the initial
    introduction school scene in Donnie Darko.</p>
      <p>The song also appears in the videogame, 
    <i>World in Conflict</i>as the main theme of the game.</p>
      <p>On the small screen, the song is perhaps best remembered for
    the eight seasons it served as the opening theme for the talk
    show 
    <i>Dennis Miller Live</i>. Other appearances include:</p>
      <p>The song appears on the game, 
    <i>Karaoke Revolution Party</i>, and is also listenable in the
    in-game radio of 
    <i>Saints Row 2</i>.</p>
      <p>The first two verses are heard in the 
    <i>Powerpuff Girls</i>episode "The Powerpuff Girls Rule!!!"
    sung by Mojo Jojo.</p>
      <p>The song was used in the beginning and during the credits of
    Mike Tollin's ESPN 30 for 30 documentary about the USFL.</p>
