      <p>"Crimson and Clover" is a song by Tommy James and the
    Shondells. It was one of the biggest hits of the 1960s and
    reached #1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and #1 in Canada in
    1969. It dropped from #18 to completely out of the Billboard
    pop charts in one week, setting a record for the farthest drop
    out of the charts.</p>
      <p>"Crimson and Clover" was completely written and recorded by
    the duo of Tommy James and Peter Lucia Jr., the Shondells
    drummer. Lucia played drums and delivered backing vocals, while
    James played all other instruments and sang the lead
    vocals.</p>
      <p>The song is famous for a unique "wobbly" vocal effect near
    the end of the song. To produce this effect, Tommy James
    plugged his microphone into a guitar amplifier, flipped the
    tremolo switch, and repeatedly sang the line "crimson and
    clover, over and over". When it was released in November 1968,
    some listeners thought he was saying "Christmas is over"
    instead of "crimson and clover."</p>
      <p>In a February 2010 promotional talk for his book 
    <i>Me, The Mob, and The Music</i>, James revealed that he never
    did finish the song before release. He took a demo into a
    Chicago radio station that clandestinely taped it. Repeated
    airings forced the release of that version.</p>
      <p>There are three releases of "Crimson and Clover".</p>
      <p>The reissue single of "Crimson And Clover" (Roulette Golden
    Goodies GG-73) was pressed with the album version although the
    label shows the single version's playing time of 3:23.</p>
      <p>The song is often incorrectly attributed to The Velvet
    Underground, Fleetwood Mac, Simon and Garfunkel or The Hollies
    on P2P networks and lyrics websites. The Velvet Underground
    instrumental song "Ride Into the Sun" from the Out-take V.U.
    album uses the same chords. Lou Reed later used the same chords
    for "Sweet Jane" on the Velvet Underground's 
    <i>Loaded</i>album. The similarities are best heard on the
    "Sweet Jane" cover Version by the Cowboy Junkies from the 
    <i>Natural Born Killers</i>Soundtrack.</p>
