      <p>"Go Away, Little Girl" is a popular song written by Gerry
    Goffin and Carole King. The lyrics consist of a young man
    asking an attractive young woman to stay away from him, so he
    won't be tempted to betray his steady girlfriend by kissing
    her. The song is notable for making the American Top 20 three
    times: for Steve Lawrence in 1962 (US #1), for The Happenings
    in 1966 (US #12), and for Donny Osmond in 1971 (US #1). It is
    also the first song, and one of only nine songs, to reach US #1
    by two different artists.</p>
      <p>In late 1962, Steve Lawrence released the original recording
    of this song. The single reached number one on the Billboard
    Hot 100 in January 1963 and remained in the top position for
    two weeks. This recording also spent six weeks atop the U.S.
    Easy Listening chart. It also went to #1 on the New Zealand
    Lever chart and #18 in Canada.</p>
      <p>Mark Wynter's 1962 cover of the song on the Pye Records
    label also made the UK Singles Chart, reaching number six in
    Britain.</p>
      <p>Donny Osmond's cover version reached number one on the Hot
    100 chart in September 1971. It remained in the top position
    for three weeks. Osmond's version also went to #36 on the
    Australian Go-Set chart.</p>
      <p>"Go Away Little Girl" has also been covered by numerous
    other artists, such as Del Shannon, Bobby Vinton and Bobby Vee
    .</p>
