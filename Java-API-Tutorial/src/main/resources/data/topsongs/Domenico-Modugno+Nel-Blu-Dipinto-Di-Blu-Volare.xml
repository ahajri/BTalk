      <p>"Nel blu dipinto di blu" ("In the Blue Painted Blue"),
    popularly known as "Volare" (Italian for the infinitive form of
    the verb "to fly"), is Domenico Modugno's signature song.</p>
      <p>Modugno's recording became the first Grammy winner for the
    Grammy Award for Record of the Year and Grammy Award for Song
    of the Year in 1958. It is the only foreign-language recording
    to achieve this honor. It spent six weeks atop the Hot 100 in
    August and September 1958 and was 
    <i>Billboard'</i>s number-one single for the year. It is one of
    only three one-hit wonders to become single of the year in the
    history of the Hot 100 (followed by "Stranger on the Shore" by
    Acker Bilk in 1962 and "Bad Day" by Daniel Powter in 2006).</p>
      <p>Written by Domenico Modugno (music and lyrics) and Franco
    Migliacci (lyrics), "Nel blu dipinto di blu" was presented by
    Domenico Modugno and Johnny Dorelli at the 1958 Sanremo Music
    Festival, winning the contest and achieving instant popularity.
    It was then chosen to represent Italy at the 1958 Eurovision
    Song Contest, where it came third.</p>
      <p>The song is a ballad in a dramatic chanson style, in which
    Modugno describes the feeling he has, which resembles flying
    when with his lover. The song opens with a surreal prelude
    which the cover versions often left out: 
    <i>"Penso che un sogno così non ritorni mai più. Mi dipingevo
    le mani e la faccia di blu; poi d'improvviso venivo dal vento
    rapito, e incominciavo a volare nel cielo infinito."</i>("I
    think that a dream like that will never return; I painted my
    hands and my face blue, then was suddenly swept up by the wind
    and started to fly in the infinite sky.")</p>
      <p>The English lyrics were written by Mitchell Parish.
    Alternative English lyrics were written in 1958 by Dame Gracie
    Fields, and they were used in most concerts she performed in
    from then until her death in 1979. She often changed the words
    to suit her performance and age.</p>
      <p>The song was performed first on the night (preceding the
    Netherlands' Corry Brokken with "Heel De Wereld"). At the end
    of the voting, it had received 13 points, placing 3rd in a
    field of 10.</p>
      <p>Due to a transmission fault, the song was not heard in all
    countries transmitting the event, so it was performed at the
    end as well, before the voting took place.</p>
      <p>It was succeeded as Italian representative at the 1959
    contest by "Piove (Ciao, ciao bambina)," also performed by
    Modugno.</p>
      <p>The song became widely known as "Volare", from its refrain,
    and reached the top of the charts all over the world through
    translations into various languages: "
    <i>Воларе (Volare)</i>" in Russian; "
    <i>Dans le bleu du ciel bleu</i>" in French, "
    <i>En el azul del cielo</i>" in Spain, "
    <i>Jouw ogen</i>" in Belgium, "
    <i>Taivaan sinessä</i>" in Finland and "
    <i>Azul pintado de azul</i>" in Brazil and Latin America.</p>
      <p>A year after the Eurovision, the 1st Grammy Awards ceremony
    was held, and Modugno received awards for both Song of the Year
    and Record of the Year. 
    <i>Billboard</i>awarded Modugno a prize for best song of the
    year, and he received three gold records from the recording
    industry: best singer, best song, best-selling album.</p>
      <p>The song's popularity endures, and it was voted as the
    second favourite entry in the history of the Eurovision Song
    Contest at the 50th anniversary concert in Copenhagen, Denmark,
    2005.</p>
      <p>The song has been covered at least 100 times over the years.
    Versions were quickly recorded after the initial success -
    partly in English, partly in Italian - by The McGuire Sisters
    and Dean Martin. Bobby Rydell had a hit with his version,
    reaching #4 on the Hot 100 in the summer of 1960 (this version
    was later played over the end credits of the 1986 movie 
    <i>Vamp</i>). An up-tempo Spanish version (partly in Italian)
    was recorded by the Gipsy Kings in 1989.</p>
      <p>The Argentinian music composer Bebu Silvetti arranged a
    disco version of this song.</p>
      <p>Sergio Franchi sang the song, with modified lyrics, as the
    television spokesman for the Plymouth Volaré in the 1970s.</p>
      <p>A version was used by fans of Arsenal to serenade the
    midfielder Patrick Vieira, and Manchester United fans have
    created versions for cult heroes Diego Forlan and Nemanja
    Vidić, as well as a parody of Arsenal's song for Vieira,
    mocking the midfielder's error in the 1999 FA Cup Semi-Final
    replay which led to Ryan Giggs' famous extra-time winner.</p>
      <p>It is also present in the video game Counter-Strike, within
    the map "de_volare."</p>
      <p>In the first season of 
    <i>Quantum Leap</i>in the episode "Double Identity", the
    character Dr. Sam Beckett is shown singing the song.</p>
      <p>The 6th season of the American version of 
    <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>featured Kristi Yamaguchi and Mark
    Ballas dancing Samba to the Gipsy Kings version of the
    song.</p>
      <p>The 1980 comedy classic film 
    <i>Hollywood Knights</i>referred to the song in a witty version
    performed by Newbomb Turk (Robert Wuhl) to the delight of a
    High School Pep Rally audience, albeit with adverse reactions
    from the sponsoring adults at the scene.</p>
      <p>Kevin Kline sings an excerpt from this song in the movie 
    <i>A Fish Called Wanda</i>.</p>
      <p>When ABBA’s "Waterloo," was voted as the "all time favourite
    song of the Eurovision Song Contest" (Volare came second), the
    creators Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus, said when they
    received the prize</p>
      <p>I myself voted for "Volare" but I am pleased that so many
    people voted for us.</p>
