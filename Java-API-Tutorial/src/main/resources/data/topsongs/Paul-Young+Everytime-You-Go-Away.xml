      <p>"Everytime You Go Away" is a song written by Daryl Hall and
    covered by Paul Young in 1985 (see 1985 in music).</p>
      <p>The original appeared on Hall &amp; Oates's 1980 album, 
    <i>Voices,</i>although it was not released as a single. Hall
    &amp; Oates also recorded it for their 1985 concert album 
    <i>Live at the Apollo</i>. Young's version hit number one on
    the Billboard Hot 100 on July 27, 1985. It remains his only
    number-one hit and one of only two top 10 hits he had on the
    U.S. pop singles chart. It also topped the U.S. adult
    contemporary chart for two weeks. The song peaked at No. 4 in
    the UK, Young's home country. The song won Best British Video
    at the 1986 Brit Awards.</p>
      <p>Young's version features a haunting combination of echoed
    piano, Pino Palladino's distinctive fretless bass and an
    electric sitar, the latter a long-neglected instrument by the
    mid-1980s.</p>
      <p>At the end of the 1987 movie, 
    <i>Planes, Trains and Automobiles</i>, the song is performed by
    Blue Room. In 2006, Clay Aiken covered the song on his CD 
    <i>A Thousand Different Ways</i>.</p>
