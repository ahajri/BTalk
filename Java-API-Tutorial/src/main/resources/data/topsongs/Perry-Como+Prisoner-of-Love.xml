      <p>"Prisoner Of Love" is a 1931 popular song with music by Russ
    Columbo and Clarence Gaskill and lyrics by Leo Robin. The song
    was popularized by Columbo and later became a major hit for
    Perry Como. It was also recorded by Billy Eckstine.</p>
      <p>Como's first recording was made on December 18, 1945 and
    released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-1814-B. It
    first reached the Billboard magazine charts on March 30, 1946
    and lasted 3 weeks on the chart, peaking at #1. The flip side
    was "All Through the Day". This recording was re-released in
    1949, by RCA Victor, as a 78rpm single (catalog number
    20-3298-A) and a 45rpm single (catalog number 47-2886), with
    the flip side "Temptation."</p>
      <p>Como made two further recordings of the song: one in
    February, 1946 for a V-Disc, number CS-656-B, and another in
    July 1970 in a live performance in Las Vegas, issued as a
    long-playing album (titled 
    <i>In Person At The International Hotel, Las Vegas</i>in its
    United States and United Kingdom releases, 
    <i>Perry Como In Person</i>in its Japanese release, and 
    <i>Perry Como In Concert</i>in its Dutch release).</p>
      <p>James Brown revived "Prisoner of Love" in 1963. It was his
    first recording to enter the pop Top 20, reaching #18. The
    studio recording was arranged by Sammy Lowe. He performed the
    song live with his vocal group, The Famous Flames on the
    concert film The T.A.M.I. Show, and on a mid-sixties telecast
    of The Ed Sullivan Show. The Flames, however, were not used on
    the studio recording, having been replaced, in this instance,
    by a female chorus.</p>
