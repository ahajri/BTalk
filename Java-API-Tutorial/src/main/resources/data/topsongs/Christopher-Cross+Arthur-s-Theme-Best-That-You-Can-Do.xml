      <p>"Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)", is a song performed
    by Christopher Cross, which was the theme to the 1981 film 
    <i>Arthur</i>starring Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli. It
    reached #1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and in Norway on the
    VG-lista chart.</p>
      <p>The song was written in collaboration between Cross, pop
    music composer Burt Bacharach, and his frequent writing partner
    Carole Bayer Sager. A fourth writing credit goes to Minnelli's
    ex-husband and Australian songwriter Peter Allen, also a
    frequent collaborator with Bayer Sager; the line "When you get
    caught between the moon and New York City" from the chorus is
    taken from an unreleased song they had previously written
    together.</p>
      <p>The song won the 1981 Academy Award for Best Original Song
    and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. The award
    was presented by singer Bette Midler, who, in her presentation
    of the nominated songs, called the song " 'That Song About the
    Moon and New York City,' also known as 'Four on a Song,' "
    referring to the four songwriters.</p>
      <p>In Japan, the song is known as ニューヨーク・シティ・セレナーデ or "New York
    City Serenade" and has enjoyed popularity over the years. Cross
    performed the song with J-pop band SMAP in 2004. The song was
    even featured in a video that played in Shibuya Crossing (the
    world's busiest scramble crossing) in 2007.</p>
      <p>It is No. 79 on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Songs</p>
