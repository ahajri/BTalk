      <p>"Crazy Little Thing Called Love" is a song performed by the
    English rock band Queen, written by singer Freddie Mercury.
    While it peaked at number two in the UK, it hit number one on
    the U.S. charts on February 23, 1980, remaining there for four
    consecutive weeks. It topped the charts in Australia for six
    weeks.</p>
      <p>As reported by Mercury in 
    <i>Melody Maker</i>, May 2, 1981, Mercury composed "Crazy
    Little Thing Called Love" on the guitar in just five to ten
    minutes. Other accounts say that he wrote it while lounging in
    a bubble bath in the Bayerischer Hof Hotel in Munich during one
    of Queen's extensive Munich recording sessions. He took it to
    the studio shortly after writing it and presented it to
    bandmates Roger Taylor and John Deacon. The three of them, with
    their new producer Mack, recorded it at Musicland Studios in
    Munich. The entire song was reportedly recorded in less than
    half an hour (although Mack says it was six hours).</p>
      <p>Although Mercury would play an electrified twelve-string on
    stage (and later a six-string electric), in the studio he
    recorded it with a six-string acoustic with external mics.
    Freddie Mercury also played the original guitar solo on a
    version which has been lost.</p>
      <p>The "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" single hit number two
    in the UK and became the first U.S. number-one hit for the
    band.</p>
      <p>American country music singer Dwight Yoakam included a cover
    of the song on his 1999 album 
    <i>Last Chance for a Thousand Years: Dwight Yoakam's Greatest
    Hits from the 90's</i>. Yoakam's version was released as a
    single, peaking at #12 on the U.S. country singles charts in
    1999. It was also used in a television commercial for clothing
    retailer Gap at the time of the album's release.</p>
      <p>The music video was directed by Yoakam.</p>
