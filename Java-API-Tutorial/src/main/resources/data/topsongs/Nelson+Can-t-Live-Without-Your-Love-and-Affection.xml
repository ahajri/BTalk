      <p>"(Can't Live Without Your) Love and Affection" is a single
    by Nelson. It was released in 1990 on Geffen Records and backed
    with "Will You Love Me". The song was based on a crush on Cindy
    Crawford.</p>
      <p>The production on the single and its B-side, "Will You Love
    Me", was done by David Thoener and Marc Tanner. It also appears
    as the first track on Nelson's album, 
    <i>After the Rain</i>.</p>
      <p>It became a number-one single on the Hot 100 in 1990, the
    duo's only chart-topper.</p>
      <p>It was also critiqued on Season 2 of 
    <i>Beavis and Butthead</i>where the boys thought they were
    "chicks who look like guys" and thought they were Ozzy
    Osbourne's granddaughters or Elvis's children.</p>
