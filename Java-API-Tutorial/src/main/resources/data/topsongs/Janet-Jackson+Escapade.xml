      <p>"Escapade" is the third single from American R&amp;B-pop
    singer Janet Jackson's fourth studio album, 
    <i>Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814</i>(1989).</p>
      <p>"Escapade" was inspired by the Martha &amp; the Vandellas
    1965 single "Nowhere to Run", which Jackson originally intended
    to remake, but instead choose to record a new song with a
    similar feel after a suggestion from producer Jimmy Jam.</p>
      <p>Written by Jackson, James Harris III, and Terry Lewis, the
    song peaked at number one on the Hot 100 for three weeks in
    early March 1990, becoming Jackson's third number-one single.
    It also topped the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Dance Club
    Play charts, and was certified gold by the RIAA.</p>
      <p>Jackson has performed the song on all of her tours,
    including the Rhythm Nation 1814 Tour, janet. Tour, The Velvet
    Rope Tour, All for You Tour, and Rock Witchu Tour.</p>
      <p>The music video for the song, directed by Peter Smillie,
    takes place at a Mardi Gras-like carnival. On April 27, 2007,
    the video was made available on the iTunes Store.</p>
      <p>The song was also featured on a Japan Airlines commercial in
    1990.</p>
      <p>"Escapade" is set in common time with a key of A major.
    Jackson's vocal chords ranges between the tonal nodes of
    high-tone Ab
    <sub>3</sub>to low-tone Eb
    <sub>5</sub>. The song is in a medium dance groove tempo of 120
    beats per minute with the chord progression being set like
    Am–E–Gb.</p>
