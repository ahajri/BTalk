      <p>"Hotel California" is the title song from the Eagles' album
    of the same name and was released as a single in early 1977. It
    is one of the best-known songs of the album-oriented rock era.
    Writing credits for the song are shared by Don Felder, Don
    Henley and Glenn Frey. The Eagles' original recording of the
    song features Henley singing the lead vocals and concludes with
    an extended section of electric guitar interplay between Felder
    and Joe Walsh.</p>
      <p>"Hotel California" topped the Billboard Hot 100 singles
    chart for one week in May 1977. Three months after its release,
    the single was certified Gold by the Recording Industry
    Association of America representing 1,000,000 records shipped.
    The Eagles also won the 1977 Grammy Award for Record of the
    Year for "Hotel California" at the 20th Annual Grammy Awards in
    1978.</p>
      <p>In 2009, the song "Hotel California" was certified Platinum
    (Digital Sales Award) by the RIAA for sales of 1,000,000
    digital downloads.</p>
      <p>The song is rated highly in many rock music lists and polls.
    
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>magazine, for example, placed it as the
    49th greatest song of all time. It is also one of The Rock and
    Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. The
    song's guitar solo is ranked 8th on 
    <i>Guitar Magazine'</i>s Top 100 Guitar Solos.</p>
      <p>As one of the group's most popular and well-known songs,
    "Hotel California" has been a concert staple for the band since
    its release; performances of the song appear on the Eagles'
    1980 live album and, in an acoustic version, on the 1994 
    <i>Hell Freezes Over</i>reunion concert CD and video release.
    The "Hell Freezes Over" version is performed using eight
    guitars in total, and has a decidedly Spanish feel to it - with
    Don Felder playing a flamenco-inspired intro. During the band's
    Farewell 1 Tour-Live from Melbourne the song was performed in a
    manner closer to the original album version, but with a trumpet
    interlude in the beginning.</p>
      <p>The song is a playable track on the video game 
    <i>Guitar Hero World Tour</i>.</p>
      <p>The song's lyrics describe the title establishment as a
    luxury resort where "you can check out anytime you like, but
    you can never leave." On the surface, the song tells the tale
    of a weary traveler who becomes trapped in a nightmarish luxury
    hotel that at first appeared inviting and tempting. The song is
    an allegory about hedonism and self-destruction in the Southern
    California music industry of the late 1970s; Don Henley called
    it "our interpretation of the high life in Los Angeles" and
    later reiterated "it's basically a song about the dark
    underbelly of the American dream and about excess in America,
    which is something we knew a lot about." In 2008, Don Felder
    described the origins of the lyrics:</p>
      <p>"Don Henley and Glenn wrote most of the words. All of us
    kind of drove into LA at night. Nobody was from California, and
    if you drive into LA at night... you can just see this glow on
    the horizon of lights, and the images that start running
    through your head of Hollywood and all the dreams that you
    have, and so it was kind of about that... what we started
    writing the song about. Coming into LA... and from that 
    <i>Life In The Fast Lane</i>came out of it, and 
    <i>Wasted Time</i>and a bunch of other songs.":</p>
      <p>The abstract nature of the lyrics has led listeners to their
    own interpretations over the years. In the 1980s, some
    Christian evangelists alleged that "Hotel California" referred
    to a San Francisco hotel purchased by Anton LaVey and converted
    into the Church of Satan. Other rumors suggested that the Hotel
    California was the Camarillo State Mental Hospital. These
    claims have been consistently refuted by the band.</p>
      <p>The term "colitas" in the first stanza of the song is a
    Spanish term for "little tails" and a reference to the buds of
    the Cannabis plant.</p>
      <p>In a 2009 interview, Plain Dealer music critic John Soeder
    asked Don Henley this about the lyrics:</p>
      <p>On "Hotel California," you sing: "So I called up the captain
    / 'Please bring me my wine' / He said, 'We haven't had that
    spirit here since 1969.'" I realize I'm probably not the first
    to bring this to your attention, but wine isn't a spirit. Wine
    is fermented; spirits are distilled. Do you regret that
    lyric?</p>
      <p>Henley responded,</p>
      <p>"Thanks for the tutorial and, no, you're not the first to
    bring this to my attention—and you're not the first to
    completely misinterpret the lyric and miss the metaphor.
    Believe me, I've consumed enough alcoholic beverages in my time
    to know how they are made and what the proper nomenclature is.
    But that line in the song has little or nothing to do with
    alcoholic beverages. It's a sociopolitical statement. My only
    regret would be having to explain it in detail to you, which
    would defeat the purpose of using literary devices in
    songwriting and lower the discussion to some silly and
    irrelevant argument about chemical processes."</p>
      <p>According to Glenn Frey's liner notes for 
    <i>The Very Best of Eagles,</i>the use of the word "steely" in
    the lyric (referring to knives) was a playful nod to band
    Steely Dan, who had included the lyric "Turn up the Eagles, the
    neighbors are listening" in their song "Everything You
    Did."</p>
