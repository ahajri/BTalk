      <p>"Ringo" is a hit single for the Canadian actor Lorne Greene
    in 1964.</p>
      <p>The song's lyrics —spoken rather than sung— tell the story
    of a Western lawman and his relationship with a notorious
    gunfighter, Ringo, presumably based on the outlaw Johnny Ringo.
    It has been pointed out that the song does not fit the known
    historical facts of the life of Johnny Ringo; this did not
    damage the song's popularity, as it shot to the top of the US 
    <i>Billboard</i>charts on December 5, 1964. It also peaked at
    #1 on the "Easy Listening" chart, where it remained at the top
    for six weeks, and at #21 on Hot Country Singles chart. (The
    fact the song had the same name as a Beatle didn't hurt.) The
    song was written by Don Robertson and Hal Blair.</p>
      <p>The 'B' side of the disc was an extended version of the
    theme song of Greene's TV show 
    <i>Bonanza</i>, with lyrics that were never used on TV. Greene
    also recorded a French version of the song, in 1965.</p>
      <p>The song was parodied by Frank Gallop in his 1966 hit
    single, "The Ballad of Irving"; by Dutch comedian Andre van
    Duin in the 1980s ("Bingo"); and by Country Yossi and the
    Shteeble Hoppers ("Shlomo").</p>
      <p>The 2005 short film "Ringo", which used the song along with
    public domain footage of John Wayne and Roy Rogers, won the
    Short Film Award for animated film at the 2005 Seattle
    International Film Festival.</p>
