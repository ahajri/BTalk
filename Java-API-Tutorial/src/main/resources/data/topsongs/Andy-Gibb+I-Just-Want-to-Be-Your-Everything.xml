      <p>"I Just Want to Be Your Everything" was a hit song by pop
    singer Andy Gibb. The first single released from his debut
    album, 
    <i>Flowing Rivers</i>, it became the first of three consecutive
    number one Billboard Hot 100 singles for Gibb. Co-written with
    his brother, Barry Gibb, it also reached number 19 on the
    R&amp;B singles chart.</p>
      <p>The song was #22 on 
    <i>Billboard's All Time Top 100.</i>[3] Kimberley Locke of
    [American Idol (season 2)|season 2] covered this song for the
    Bee Gees themed week (Top 4). Jason Castro of season 7 covered
    this song on the show for the 70's themed week.</p>
      <p>According to Amy Hanson of Allmusic, Andy Gibb viewed "I
    Just Want to Be Your Everything" as "one of the most personal
    and meaningful songs he ever performed." Although brother Barry
    is the only credited writer for the song, both he and Andy
    wrote "Everything" in Bermuda as a tribute to Andy's recent
    marriage and his new wife.</p>
      <p>"Everything" was Gibb's first single release in the United
    States. Released in May 1977, the song quickly broke in
    popularity and by the end of July, reached the top of the
    Billboard Hot 100.</p>
      <p>"Everything" spent a cumulative four weeks at No. 1 on the
    Billboard Hot 100. The song first reached the top of the chart
    on July 30 for the first of three consecutive weeks. Then, The
    Emotions went to No. 1 with "Best of My Love" on August 20 for
    the first of four straight weeks.</p>
      <p>However, "Everything" maintained strong popularity,
    remaining in the Top 10 before returning to No. 1 for one final
    week on September 15. "Everything" then fell out of the top
    spot for good, being replaced once again by "Best of My
    Love."</p>
      <p>"Everything" enjoyed one of the longest Top 40 runs in the
    Billboard Hot 100 to that time; its 23-week run spanned from
    the end of May through the end of October.</p>
      <p>The song also peaked on the Black Singles Chart, peaking at
    number 19.</p>
      <p>The best-known cover version of "I Just Want to Be Your
    Everything" was recorded by American country music artist,
    Connie Smith. Released in the fall of 1977, Smith's version,
    according to AMG reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, was
    "relatively faithful" to Gibb's version and — given its
    disco-influenced sound — also a departure from her honky-tonk
    songs of the 1960s and early 1970s.</p>
      <p>"I Just Want to Be Your Everything" peaked at #14 on 
    <i>Billboard Magazine'</i>s Hot Country Songs chart in 1978,
    becoming her last significant hit, as her further hits for
    Monument Records, such as "Lovin' You Baby" and "They'll Never
    Be Another for Me," peaked in progressively lower positions on
    the country chart between 1978 and 1979.</p>
