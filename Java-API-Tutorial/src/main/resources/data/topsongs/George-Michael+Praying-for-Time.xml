      <p>"Praying for Time" is a U.S. number-one song written and
    performed by George Michael, released on Epic Records in
    1990.</p>
      <p>The song was Michael's first single in almost two years,
    entering the UK Singles Chart in August 1990.</p>
      <p>A dark and sombre reflection on social ills and injustice,
    the song was hailed by critics as it peaked at number six in
    the UK, but it was his ninth number one on the Hot 100 in the
    USA. The song remained in the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Top 40 for ten weeks. George used an echoey
    vocal effect and put the melody in a low enough key to take
    away the sunny nature of his regular singing voice. It was the
    first song of political motivation he had released as a single
    since his earliest days with Wham!.</p>
      <p>The song was the first of five released in the UK from the
    album 
    <i>Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1</i>, although it was the
    only one of the quintet to make the UK Top 10.</p>
      <p>While George Michael refused to appear in videos to support
    the album, but an experimental video clip for "Praying for
    Time" was released, directed by Michael Borofsky featuring only
    the lyrics of the song with a blue and black background that,
    at the end of the clip, reveals itself to be the image on the
    cover of the album. The completely Un-George Michael style
    video quickly became a buzz clip on MTV, and stayed in rotation
    on most video networks for weeks. Similarly, the commercial had
    no cover photo, only words.</p>
      <p>The song was performed by Carrie Underwood for the 2008 
    <i>Idol Gives Back</i>mini-marathon on April 9, 2008. In a
    matter of 24 hours, Underwood's rendition of "Praying for Time"
    reached #10 on the Hot Digital Songs chart, with all proceeds
    being donated to charity. It also peaked at #27 on the U.S.
    Billboard Hot 100 on the week of April 26, 2008.</p>
      <p>The song was performed by George Michael himself during the
    2008 
    <i>American Idol</i>Finale on May 21, 2008. At the conclusion
    of his performance, host Ryan Seacrest greeted Michael,Michael
    said he was sick and also, confirmed that his North American
    leg of 25 Live tour would kick off in San Diego on June 17,
    2008.</p>
