      <p>"This Is the Night", released on June 3, 2003 on the RCA
    label, was American Idol contestant Clay Aiken's debut CD
    single and was written by Chris Braide, Aldo Nova and Gary
    Burr.</p>
      <p>It was released simultaneously with "Flying Without Wings"
    by rival contestant Ruben Studdard, and immediately reached
    number one on the Hot 100, restricting "Flying Without Wings"
    to the number-two position.</p>
      <p>The double A-side single was RIAA certified platinum on July
    15, 2003. Debuting at number one on both the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot 100 (on June 17, 2003) and the Hot 100
    Single Sales Chart, it was the fastest-selling single since
    Elton John's "Candle in the Wind 1997" and the best-selling
    single of 2003. It was the first CD single to go platinum since
    2002, when Lee Ann Womack's "I Hope You Dance" sold a million
    copies after being released for over a year. The single also
    topped the charts in New Zealand where it was certified
    platinum, and went six times platinum in Canada.</p>
      <p>"This Is the Night" was included as a bonus track on Aiken's
    
    <i>Measure of a Man</i>CD (October 2003), while on some
    international versions the bonus track was "Bridge Over
    Troubled Water".</p>
