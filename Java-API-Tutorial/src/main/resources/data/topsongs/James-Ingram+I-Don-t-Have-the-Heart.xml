      <p>"I Don't Have the Heart" is the title of a popular song that
    was written by Allan Rich and Jud Friedman and recorded by
    American pop-R&amp;B singer James Ingram.</p>
      <p>Released as the fourth single from Ingram's 1989 album 
    <i>It's Real</i>, "I Don't Have the Heart" reached the top of
    the Hot 100 chart on October 20, 1990. The ballad remained at
    #1 for one week. Singer Stacy Lattisaw recorded the song as
    well, and her version was released on Motown Records at the
    same time as Ingram's, although it was not as commercially
    successful. According to songwriter Rich, "the record company
    was not behind her."</p>
