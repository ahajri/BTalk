      <p>"Total Eclipse of the Heart" is a song written and produced
    by Jim Steinman and recorded by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler in
    1983 on her fifth studio album 
    <i>Faster Than the Speed of Night</i>. The song was the first
    single release from the album and is Tyler's biggest hit.</p>
      <p>The song remains Tyler's most successful song, peaking at #1
    in the United States, Australia, Canada, and the United
    Kingdom. At its peak, it sold 60,000 copies per day, and
    approximately 6 million copies in total. It won the Variety
    Club award in the UK for best single of 1983.</p>
      <p>According to Meat Loaf, Steinman had given the song, along
    with "Making Love (Out of Nothing At All)", to Meat Loaf for
    his 
    <i>Midnight at the Lost and Found</i>album. However, Meat
    Loaf's record company refused to pay for Steinman and he wrote
    separate songs himself. "Total Eclipse of the Heart" was then
    given to Bonnie Tyler and "Making Love (Out of Nothing At All)"
    to Air Supply.</p>
      <p>The music video for "Total Eclipse of the Heart" was
    directed by Russell Mulcahy. It was story-boarded by Jim
    Steinman and drew inspiration from the 1976 film 
    <i>Futureworld</i>. The Gothic themed video features Bonnie
    Tyler clad in white, apparently having a dream or fantasy about
    her students in a boys' boarding school. Young men are seen
    dancing and participating in various school activities such as
    swim team, karate, fencing, football, and singing in a choir.
    The video was shot at Holloway Sanatorium.</p>
      <p>The original version of the song, on 
    <i>Faster Than the Speed of Night</i>, was just over seven
    minutes in length. Thus, an edited version was, and still is
    most commonly played on radio. The radio version is four and a
    half minutes, and removes the entire third verse and trims the
    extended fade-out ending. The music video version is roughly
    one minute longer than the radio version.</p>
      <p>In November 2002, it was voted the #72 in "The Greatest
    Number Ones Of All Time" in UK. It was also voted #94 in the
    "Greatest Music Videos of All Time" poll held by Channel 4. In
    October, 2006, VH1's "100 Greatest Songs of the 80s" special
    included "Total Eclipse of the Heart" at #56. MuchMoreMusic
    aired a four-episode series in 2006 titled 
    <i>Top 50 Guilty Pleasures</i>, and listed the song at #9.</p>
      <p>It has been covered several times, and rewritten with
    Michael Kunze for the musical 
    <i>Tanz der Vampire</i>as "Totale Finsternis".</p>
      <p>Nicki French released a dance cover of the song in 1994,
    which was also a worldwide hit. In the United States, French's
    version peaked at #2 on the Hot 100 and garnered frequent
    airplay on CHR and AC radio. It also reached #5 in the UK
    Singles Chart after being re-issued in 1995. On June 2006 Nicki
    French released an updated version of the track with the Diva
    DJs.</p>
