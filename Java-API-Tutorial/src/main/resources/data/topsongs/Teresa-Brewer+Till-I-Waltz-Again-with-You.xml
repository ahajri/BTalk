      <p>"Till I Waltz Again with You" is a popular song written by
    Sid Prosen and published in 1952. Rather than a waltz, it is a
    slow AABA shuffle.</p>
      <p>The recording by Teresa Brewer was recorded on August 19,
    1952 and released by Coral Records as catalog number 60873. It
    first reached the Billboard magazine Best Seller chart on
    December 6, 1952 and lasted 22 (7 weeks at #1) weeks on the
    chart, peaking at #1. The song also reached #1 on the Cash Box
    chart for 6 weeks in 1953. In April 1953, during his senior
    year in high school, Elvis Presley sang the song in his high
    school's "Annual Minstrel" show. Presley recalled that the
    performance did much for his reputation: "I wasn't popular in
    school ... I failed musicâ€”only thing I ever failed. And then
    they entered me in this talent show ... when I came onstage I
    heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth,
    'cause nobody knew I even sang. It was amazing how popular I
    became after that."</p>
      <p>According to some sources, a record by Dick Todd reached
    #17, one by Russ Morgan reached #23, and one by The Harmonicats
    reached #26 on the charts, as well. Coral successfully marketed
    the song to the country audience. A version by South Carolinian
    Tommy Sosebea reached #7 on Billboard's most played by country
    disc jockeys survey.</p>
      <p>The song was recorded by Alma Cogan and Joan Regan in the
    United Kingdom around the same time.</p>
