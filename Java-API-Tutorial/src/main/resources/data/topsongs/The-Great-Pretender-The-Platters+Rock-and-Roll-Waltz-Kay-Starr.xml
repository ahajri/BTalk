      <p>"(The) Rock and Roll Waltz" is a popular song. The music was
    written by Shorty Allen and the lyrics by Roy Alfred in
    1955.</p>
      <p>The song is told from the point-of-view of a teenager who
    comes home early from a date, and catches her parents
    attempting to dance to one of her rock and roll records; only,
    having no frame of reference, the couple tries to waltz to the
    music.</p>
      <p>The Kay Starr recording of the song, made in 1955, reached
    the #1 position on the Billboard chart in 1956, staying there
    for six weeks. The recording was released by RCA Victor as
    catalog number 47-6359. It was Kay Starr's first recording of
    great significance for RCA Victor after leaving Capitol
    Records, She had a number of lesser chart entries om RCA in
    1955 including "Good and Lonesome" and "Turn Right". She
    thought it was a joke when the A&amp;R staff at RCA Victor
    picked it for her; it was so different from what she was used
    to recording. Although it was a #1 hit and a million seller,
    and she has come to love the song with the passage of time, it
    was never a song people requested her to sing at any live
    performance in the days of its popularity.</p>
      <p>Another version was later recorded by Ann-Margret in the
    early 1960s.</p>
      <p>The song may have been parodied in an episode of Tiny Toon
    Adventures by the character, Elmyra Duff ("Hop two three, bop
    two three!").</p>
