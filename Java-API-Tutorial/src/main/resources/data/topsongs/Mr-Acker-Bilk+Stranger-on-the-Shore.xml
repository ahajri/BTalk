      <p>"Stranger on the Shore" is a piece for clarinet written by
    Acker Bilk for his young daughter and originally named 
    <i>Jenny</i>after her. It was subsequently used as the theme
    tune of a BBC TV drama serial for young people that was also
    called 
    <i>Stranger on the Shore</i>.</p>
      <p>The track, performed by Bilk (as "Mr. Acker Bilk") with
    backing by the Leon Young String Chorale, was released as a
    single on Columbia Records DB 4750 in October 1961, with the
    label of the single openly proclaiming "Theme from the BBC TV.
    Series". The B-side was "Take My Lips". The single became a
    phenomenal success, topping the 
    <i>NME</i>singles chart and spending nearly a year on the 
    <i>Record Retailer</i>Top 50. It was the UK's biggest-selling
    single of 1962, the biggest-selling instrumental single of all
    time, and appears fifty-eighth in the official UK list of
    best-selling singles issued in 2002.</p>
      <p>On May 26, 1962, "Stranger on the Shore" became the first
    British recording to reach number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot
    100 where it was issued by Atlantic Records on the Atco label,
    but it was quickly followed, on December 22, by The Tornados'
    "Telstar", another instrumental. In the pre-rock era, Vera
    Lynn's "Auf Wiederseh'n Sweetheart" had reached #1 in 1952, on
    the shorter "Best Sellers In Stores" survey. After "Telstar",
    the next British performers to top the U.S. charts were The
    Beatles, with their first Capitol Records single "I Want to
    Hold Your Hand". "Stranger on the Shore" was 
    <i>Billboard'</i>s #1 single of 1962, and it spent seven weeks
    atop the "Easy Listening" chart, which would later become known
    as the Adult Contemporary chart. The tune became the second of
    three "one hit wonders" named pop single of the year by 
    <i>Billboard</i>(the others being 1958's "Volare (Nel Blu Di
    Pinto Di Blu)" by Domenico Modugno and 2006's "Bad Day" by
    Daniel Powter.</p>
      <p>In May 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 took "Stranger on the
    Shore" on their mission to the moon. Gene Cernan, a member of
    the crew, included the tune on a cassette tape used in the
    command module of the Apollo spacecraft.</p>
      <p>The composition has been covered by many other artists, most
    prominently a vocal version by Andy Williams, a group vocal
    version by The Drifters, and a soprano sax smooth jazz
    adaptation by Kenny G. It was also sampled (with a writer's
    credit for Bilk) on "A Melody From a Past Life Keeps Pulling Me
    Back" by The KLF on their album 
    <i>Chill Out</i>, and on the track "Music For Libraries" by Way
    Out West.</p>
      <p>The song was also featured in the soundtrack to 
    <i>Mr. Holland's Opus</i>, as well as in the1988 film, 
    <i>Red Heat</i>, the 1998 romantic comedy 
    <i>There's Something About Mary</i>and the 2001 movie 
    <i>The Majestic</i>.</p>
      <p>The song was playing in the scene in the 2008 Season 2
    finale of 
    <i>Mad Men</i>when Betty Draper was having a drink in a
    bar.</p>
      <p>The song is used as the theme tune to BBC Radio 4 sketch
    show 
    <i>That Mitchell and Webb Sound</i>.</p>
