      <p>"Brandy (You're a Fine Girl)" is a 1972 pop song written by
    Elliot Lurie and recorded by Lurie's band Looking Glass on
    their debut album 
    <i>Looking Glass</i>. The single reached number one on the
    Billboard Hot 100 chart, remaining in the top position for one
    week. Horns and strings were arranged by Larry Fallon.</p>
      <p>The lyrics tell of Brandy, a barmaid in a port town. She
    wins the admiration of many of the sailors, but cannot return
    their feelingsâ€”the love of her life was unwilling to abandon
    his true love, the sea. In spite of this, Brandy continues to
    love the sailor and wears a braided silver chain with a locket
    that bears his name. It's been suggested the song is inspired
    by the real life story of Mary Ellis, whose grave resides in
    New Brunswick, New Jersey where the band was formed.</p>
      <p>"Brandy" was the B-side of another Looking Glass song, and
    is rumored to have become an accidental hit when a DJ played
    the wrong side of the 45; although the flip side "One by One"
    has a running time of 6:01, which makes the rumor somewhat
    improbable.</p>
      <p>The success of "Brandy" created a bit of difficulty for
    Looking Glass, in that the song's mellow pop sound was atypical
    of their normally somewhat harder-edged style; many fans of the
    single who attended the band's concerts were reportedly taken
    aback by a more rockish sounding band than they'd been
    expecting to hear.</p>
      <p>Barry Manilow's 1974 "Mandy" was originally titled "Brandy"
    but Manilow changed it following the success of the Looking
    Glass single, so as not to get the two songs confused.</p>
      <p>This song was used in the films 
    <i>Lords of Dogtown</i>,
    <i>Charlie's Angels</i>, and 
    <i>LymeLife</i>.</p>
      <p>Doug Heffernan sings this song at karaoke in an episode of 
    <i>The King of Queens</i>.</p>
      <p>Following the song's release in 1972, "Brandy" increased in
    popularity as a girl's name in the United States. According to
    data from the Social Security Administration [1], drawn from
    "Social Security card applications for births that occurred in
    the United States, Brandy was the 353rd most popular name in
    1971, 140th in 1972, and, in 1973 (the first full year after
    the song's popularity), 82nd.</p>
