      <p>"Rock On" is a song that was composed and sung by English
    singer/songwriter David Essex. In March of 1974, it was a Top 5
    song (reaching the #5 position) on the U.S. Hot 100 pop-music
    chart. It was Essex's only 
    <i>Billboard</i>Top 40 hit. The song also reached the #3 spot
    on the UK Singles Chart. "Rock On" was the title track to
    Essex's 1973 debut album and was also featured on the
    soundtrack album to the 1973 film 
    <i>That'll Be the Day</i>, in which Essex had a starring role.
    The song can still frequently be heard on classic rock and
    oldies radio stations.</p>
      <p>Essex later re-recorded the song in 1988 with updated
    lyrics. The version, which was remixed by Shep Pettibone,
    appeared on Essex's 1989 album 
    <i>Touching the Ghost.</i>A single release of the updated
    version reached No. 93 on the U.K. charts.</p>
      <p>The Essex recording was also featured in the movies 
    <i>Dick,</i>
         <i>The Devil's Rejects</i>and 
    <i>Sunset Strip,</i>as well as on episodes of 
    <i>The Sopranos</i>and 
    <i>Cold Case.</i>
      </p>
      <p>The song features a slow-tempo, soulful vocal delivery sung
    in a minor key, along with a minimalist, heavily-bass-driven
    instrumental accompaniment to Essex's vocals. The lyrics pay
    homage to early rock and roll and its surrounding youth
    subculture, and notably pay tribute to 1950s iconic rebel James
    Dean. The vocals are punctuated with distortion and echo
    effects to add to the soulful, hip, "power delivery" of Essex's
    lyrics. Still further adding to the song's emotion-laden,
    slightly-haunting feel is a heartbeat-sounding percussive hook
    at the beginning of the song, an atonal string glide in the
    middle of the song, a very brief duet with a
    very-soulful-sounding, deep-voiced backup singer towards the
    end of the song, and muffled-sounding, staccato percussive
    riffs interspersed throughout the song.</p>
      <p>"Rock On" was covered by soap opera star and singer Michael
    Damian in 1989 and featured in the teen film, 
    <i>Dream a Little Dream,</i>starring Corey Haim and Corey
    Feldman, among others.</p>
      <p>Damian's version, which he also released from his
    independent album 
    <i>Where Do We Go From Here</i>on the Cypress Records label,
    which A&amp;M Records distributed, was a harder-edged
    interpretation that employed none of the vocal or instrumental
    distortion Essex's version had used. It reached the #1 position
    on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot 100 chart, thus outperforming Essex's
    original Billboard ranking. However, the song did get to #1 for
    Essex in '74 on the US Cashbox charts, the same week it was at
    #11 on the Billboard Charts.</p>
      <p>This version was ranked #99 on VH1's 
    <i>100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of the 80s.</i>
      </p>
      <p>The English hard-rock band Def Leppard covered the song on
    their 2006 album, 
    <i>Yeah!</i>, which features cover versions of 1970s rock hits.
    It was released as the second single from the album.</p>
      <p>The American alternative-rock group The Smashing Pumpkins
    included a live cover version of "Rock On", performed during
    their 
    <i>Sacred and Profane</i>tour, on their 2001-release album 
    <i>Judas Ã˜</i>, a bonus disc (containing B-sides and rarities)
    which accompanied the group's greatest hits album 
    <i>Rotten Apples</i>.</p>
