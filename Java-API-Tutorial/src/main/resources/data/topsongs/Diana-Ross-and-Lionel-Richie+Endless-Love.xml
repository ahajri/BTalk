      <p>"Endless Love" is a song originally recorded as a duet
    between soul singers Diana Ross and Lionel Richie, who wrote
    the song. In this ballad, the singers declare their "endless
    love" for one another. It was covered by soul singer Luther
    Vandross with pop/R&amp;B singer Mariah Carey, by country music
    singer Kenny Rogers, and also by the cast of Glee.</p>
      <p>Ross and Richie recorded the song for Motown, and it was
    used as the theme for the film 
    <i>Endless Love</i>starring Brooke Shields. Produced by Richie
    and arranged by Gene Page, it was released as a single from the
    film's soundtrack in 1981. While the film 
    <i>Endless Love</i>was a failure, the song became the second
    biggest-selling single of the year (first was "Physical" by
    Olivia Newton-John) in the U.S. and landed at number 1 on 
    <i>Billboard'</i>s Hot 100, where it stayed for nine weeks from
    August 9 to October 10, 1981. It also topped the Billboard
    R&amp;B chart and the Adult Contemporary chart, and landed at
    number 7 in the UK.</p>
      <p>The soulful composition became the biggest-selling single of
    Ross' career, while it was one of several hits for Richie as
    the 1980s progressed. Ross recorded a solo version of the song
    for her first RCA Records album, 
    <i>Why Do Fools Fall in Love?</i>, but the famous version was
    her last hit on Motown. The song was nominated for an Academy
    Award for Best Original Song for Richie, and was the second
    song with which Ross was involved that was nominated for an
    Oscar. It also won a 1982 American Music Award for Favorite
    Pop/Rock Single.</p>
      <p>The song was included in Adam Sandler's movie 
    <i>Happy Gilmore</i>when Happy and his girlfriend Virginia are
    ice skating, and the song begins to play. Virginia says to
    Happy "I thought we were just going to be friends." To which he
    responds, "Friends listen to Endless Love in the dark."</p>
      <p>The song was included as well in the third season of 
    <i>Friends</i>, in which Phoebe walks into Chandler and Joey´s
    flat, just to find Chandler singing the song and holding Lionel
    Ritchie's first album, even though the song is included in his
    fourth album, 
    <i>Back to Front</i>and also in a special 1981 single.</p>
      <p>On an episode of 
    <i>The Steve Harvey Show</i>, Steve and Regina perform the song
    at a janitor's urging (who thought they were Ross and Richie);
    at the end of the song, the janitor quips "no wonder you guys
    haven't had a hit in a while."</p>
      <p>The song was also one of the most popular wedding dedication
    songs in the 1980s.</p>
      <p>Walter Afanasieff produced Luther Vandross and Mariah
    Carey's cover of the song for Vandross' Epic Records-released
    album 
    <i>Songs</i>, and it is known for being Carey's first
    "high-profile" duet (an earlier duet, "I'll Be There," was with
    the then-unknown background singer Trey Lorenz). At the 1995
    Grammy Awards, the song was nominated in the new category of
    Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals, losing to "Funny How Time
    Slips Away" by Al Green and Lyle Lovett. Columbia Records later
    included the song on Carey's compilation album 
    <i>Greatest Hits</i>(2001) and then again on her next
    compilation album, 
    <i>The Ballads</i>(2008). It was released as the second single
    from 
    <i>Songs</i>in 1994.</p>
      <p>Sony Music Entertainment President Tommy Mottola suggested
    that Vandross record 
    <i>Songs</i>, an album of cover versions. Featuring Vandross'
    versions of songs like Stephen Stills' "Love the One You're
    With," Heatwave's "Always and Forever," and Roberta Flack's
    "Killing Me Softly," the album was shaping up to be a major
    career accomplishment. To give the album a bigger boost,
    Mottola's wife, Mariah Carey, came up with the idea to remake
    "Endless Love" as a duet with her. Lionel Richie and Diana Ross
    had originally recorded "Endless Love" in 1981, and the song
    spent nine weeks at number 1. Although Luther's album was
    already set to contain one Lionel Richie composition, "Hello,"
    it was obvious that having the most-popular female singer on
    the Sony label singing on the album would be a benefit.</p>
      <p>"Endless Love" debuted on September 10, 1994 at 31 and
    peaked at number two. The song became Luther Vandross' biggest
    pop hit ever and gave Lionel Richie his first top ten as a
    songwriter in seven years. It became Vandross's fifth top ten
    single and Carey's twelfth. It remained in the top forty for
    thirteen weeks, and was ranked number 56 on the Hot 100 1994
    year-end charts. It was also an improvement over Carey's
    previous single, "Anytime You Need a Friend," which had missed
    the top ten. It was certified gold by the RIAA.</p>
      <p>The song was a success outside the U.S, reaching the top of
    the chart in New Zealand (for five weeks) and the top five in
    the United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland, and the Netherlands. It
    also reached the top twenty in most of the countries. It was
    certified gold in Australia by ARIA and in New Zealand by
    RIANZ.</p>
      <p>Two music videos were released for the single; one features
    Carey and Vandross recording the song in a studio, and the
    other shows the two performing the song live at Royal Albert
    Hall. The latter performance is included on the Luther
    Vandross: From Luther with Love music video collection in DVD
    format.</p>
      <p>Some versions of the song itself were released, in which
    Carey or Vandross sings solo.</p>
      <p>It has been sung by John O'Connell.</p>
      <p>The song was also covered by contestant Laura White on UK
    singing competition 
    <i>The X Factor</i>, during a Mariah Carey themed week. Despite
    receiving high praise from Carey herself and most of the show's
    judges, Laura was eliminated, leading to huge controversy in
    the UK media.</p>
      <p>
         <i>The Sean Hannity Show</i>occasionally plays a mashup of this
    song with clips of various news outlets' coverage of President
    Barack Obama to demonstrate what Hannity felt was overly
    positive coverage of Obama.</p>
      <p>The song was covered in an episode of the Fox TV series 
    <i>Glee</i>by Lea Michele and Matthew Morrison. The episode is
    entitled Ballad.</p>
      <p>The song has been performed three times on 
    <i>American Idol</i>, by Rickey Smith, Chris Sligh, and Danny
    Gokey. The song was also performed on Australian Idol in 2007
    by eventual winner Natalie Gauci on the Final 7 Birth Year
    theme night.</p>
