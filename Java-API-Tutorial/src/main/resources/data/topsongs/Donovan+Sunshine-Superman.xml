      <p>"Sunshine Superman" is a song written and recorded by
    Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan. The "Sunshine Superman"
    single was released in the United States through Epic Records
    (Epic 5-10045) in July 1966, but due to a contractual dispute
    the United Kingdom release was delayed until December 1966,
    where it appeared on Donovan's previous label, Pye Records (Pye
    7N 17241). The "Sunshine Superman" single was backed with "The
    Trip" on both the United States and United Kingdom releases. It
    has been described as having, "proven to be [one of the]
    classics of the era," and as, "the quintessential bright summer
    sing along".</p>
      <p>"Sunshine Superman" reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100
    in the United States, and subsequently became the title track
    of Donovan's third album, 
    <i>Sunshine Superman</i>. A different mix of "The Trip"
    (without harmonica) is also included in the album. It was the
    first product from the highly successful three-year
    collaboration between Donovan and producer Mickie Most and is
    generally considered to be one of the first examples of the
    musical genre that came to be known as psychedelia.</p>
      <p>The song was written personally for Donovan's future wife
    Linda Lawrence.</p>
      <p>The lyrics of the song mention not only Superman, but also
    another DC Comics superhero, Green Lantern.</p>
      <p>Chart positions were #1 (US), #2 (UK).</p>
      <p>A longer version (4:23) was released on 
    <i>Donovan's Greatest Hits</i>(1969)</p>
      <p>An even longer verison (4:34) was released on 
    <i>Donovan's Greatest Hits and More</i>(1989)</p>
      <p>The song has been covered by Hüsker Dü on their 1983 album, 
    <i>Everything Falls Apart</i>, the New York punk band Alice
    Donut on their debut album 
    <i>Donut Comes Alive</i>, Canadian folk rock group Spirit of
    the West on the 1992 Donovan tribute album 
    <i>Island of Circles,</i>by Jewel, the American
    singer/songwriter, for the soundtrack of the 1996 film 
    <i>I Shot Andy Warhol. It was covered by The Films for the
    Sound of Superman, a companion album to 2006 film Superman
    Returns.</i>

      <p>Trini Lopez included a version of the song on his Reprise
    Records album 
    <i>The Whole Enchilada.</i>(Reprise 6337), as has Mel
    Torme.</p>
      <p>On August 9th 1969 in Atlantic City - Recorded Live on "Move
    Your Hand" by Dr. Lonnie Smith</p>
      <p>In 1997, the song was sampled by Imani Coppola for her
    single, "Legend of a Cowgirl".</p>
      <p>In 2005 Rickie Lee Jones covered the song on "Duchess of
    Coolsville: An Anthology"</p>
      <p>In 2006 the song was used in a TV advertisement for Magners
    Irish cider.</p>
      <p>In 2010 a cover of the song was used by Honda for their
    Accord Crosstour</p>
      <p>Writer Grant Morrison referenced the song in an issue of 
    <i>Animal Man</i>by creating Sunshine Superman, an African
    American version of Superman who was a member of the Love
    Syndicate of Dreamworld, from a world based on the drug culture
    of the 1960s. Sunshine Superman and his world were wiped out by
    the Crisis on Infinite Earths, only to be brought back by the
    Psycho-Pirate before fading away again. Sunshine Superman
    returned for a brief, non-speaking cameo in 
    <i>Final Crisis</i>#7, in an army of alternate Supermen..</p>
      <p>Also Covered by Dr .Lonnie Smith Recorded Live on "Move Your
    Hand" in Atlantic City August 9th 1969</p>
