      <p>"A Big Hunk o' Love", a song sung by Elvis Presley, was
    recorded on June 10, 1958 in RCA's Nashville, Tennessee studio,
    while Presley was on leave from the U.S. Army. It was released
    as a single A-side on June 23, 1959. Its B-side was "My Wish
    Came True". It was Presley's twelfth number-one hit (his last
    of the 1950s), and it reached number four in the United
    Kingdom. "A Big Hunk o' Love" peaked at number ten on the
    R&amp;B charts . The song was recorded in four takes, the
    released version is actually spliced from takes three and
    four.</p>
      <p>The song was revived by Presley in 1972 during his
    engagements at the Las Vegas Hilton in February 1972 and was
    used in his live shows until mid 1973. It was performed live
    for the last time on January 26, 1974. The song is included in
    the 1972 documentary 
    <i>Elvis On Tour</i>and his 1973 show broadcast via satellite, 
    <i>Aloha from Hawaii</i>. During this time period, it was
    played by the Elvis' TCB Band, and featured Glen D. Hardin and
    James Burton.</p>
