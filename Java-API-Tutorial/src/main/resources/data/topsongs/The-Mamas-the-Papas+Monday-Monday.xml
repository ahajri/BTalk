         <i>For the UK Comedy drama, see Monday Monday.</i>
      </p>
      <p>"Monday, Monday" is a 1966 song written by John Phillips and
    recorded by The Mamas &amp; the Papas for their 1966 album 
    <i>If You Can Believe Your Eyes and Ears</i>. It was the
    group's only number one hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and
    the first song by a sexually integrated group to reach the top
    of the charts.</p>
      <p>This song is noted for its false ending, when there is a
    pause before the coda of the song. This song is noted for going
    up a half note for the bridges, as well as the refrains of the
    song.</p>
      <p>On March 2, 1967, The Mamas &amp; the Papas won a Grammy
    Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for
    this song.</p>
