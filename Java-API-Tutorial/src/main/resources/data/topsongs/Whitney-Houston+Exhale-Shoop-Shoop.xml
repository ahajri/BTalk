      <p>"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)" is a 1995 hit single by R&amp;B/pop
    singer Whitney Houston, featured on the soundtrack of the film 
    <i>Waiting to Exhale</i>. Babyface was nominated for the Grammy
    Award for Song of the Year and the Grammy Award for Best Song
    Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media
    and won the Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song. Whitney Houston
    was nominated for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance.</p>
      <p>The song, written and produced by Kenneth "Babyface"
    Edmonds, is a call to handle the emotional pain of a breakup by
    leaning on your friends. Houston sings the lyrics "
    <i>When you got friends to wish you well... you'll find the
    point when, you will exhale</i>". The song is also notable for
    the 1960s arrangement of the chorus, repeating 'shoop shoop
    shoo-be-doop.'</p>
      <p>The camera mainly focuses on Houston with close-ups as she
    sings. The video is also cut with intermediate scenes from the 
    <i>Waiting To Exhale</i>movie. Directed by Forest Whitaker.</p>
      <p>Houston entered the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 at the #1
    position with "Exhale", becoming only the third single in U.S.
    history to enter at number one and Houston's eleventh and to
    date last number one single on the Billboard Hot 100. It stayed
    at number-one for just one week as Mariah Carey and Boyz II
    Men's duet "One Sweet Day" debuted at the summit the next week.
    This in turn led to "Exhale" settling into the number-two
    position where it resided for eleven weeks, becoming the single
    with the longest stay at number two on the U.S. Hot 100 in 
    <i>Billboard</i>history. The single was certified platinum, and
    remained in the Top 40 for twenty weeks.</p>
      <p>The song was also successful on other 
    <i>Billboard</i>charts, logging eight consecutive weeks at
    number one on the U.S. R&amp;B chart. The song also reached
    number five on the Adult Contemporary chart.</p>
      <p>The song performed well in a few other major markets outside
    the U.S., reaching number one in Canada, the top ten in both
    Italy and Switzerland, and the top twenty in the UK and
    France.</p>
