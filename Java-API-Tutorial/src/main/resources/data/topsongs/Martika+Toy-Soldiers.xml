      <p>"Toy Soldiers" is a song by Martika appearing on her
    eponymous debut album in 1989 as a ballad. The single was a
    number-one hit in the United States.</p>
      <p>Martika is the only one singing throughout the song,
    although the chorus of the song consisted of some of Martika's
    former castmates from 
    <i>Kids Incorporated</i>, including Stacy Ferguson, Rahsaan
    Patterson, Renee Sands, Shanice Wilson, Jennifer Love Hewitt,
    and Devyn Puett as backup vocalists.</p>
      <p>Years later, Martika claimed that the inspiration for the
    song came from a friend who was battling cocaine addiction at
    the time, according to an episode of VH-1's 
    <i>Pop-Up Video</i>in which the video was featured, the friend
    in question ultimately beat the addiction.</p>
      <p>However this claim was retrospective, as neither Martika nor
    Columbia made any such claim at the time of the song's release
    in 1989, and the song's 'anti-drug' reputation was little more
    than a happy coincidence - in reality it was a standard
    teen-love song theme about being over-attached to a
    uninterested, abusive 'bad-boy' boyfriend.</p>
      <p>At the time of the song's release, there was growing public
    concern about drug addiction in the young, and a number of
    campaigns throughout most of the world during the AIDS crisis
    warning of the dangers posed by discarded needles, emphasising
    that even without the needle a used syringe was still dangerous
    to a child, who might wish to play with one as if it were an
    old fashioned peg doll or toy soldier.</p>
      <p>Songs comparing heroin addiction to an abusive love affair
    have been a music staple for decades (eg. The Stranglers 1979
    single 'Don't Bring Harry'), and 'Toy Soldiers' motifs of
    emptiness replacing pain, addiction to something they know is
    not good for them, and a fear of the consequences if it is not
    ended (along with the children singing 'won't you come along
    and play with me?') resulted in the song's heavy rotation by
    radio and TV as anti-drugs due to the ambiguous nature of the
    lyrics.</p>
      <p>The song spent two weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot
    100 in the U.S. and New Zealand while reaching the top ten in
    the UK. When it spent its first week at number one, it had
    leapt over Madonna's "Express Yourself" and kept that song from
    reaching the top spot. On Billboard's year-end chart for 1989,
    "Toy Soldiers" placed number 29. It was Martika's only
    number-one single in the U.S., and her highest-ranking single
    in the UK. The single was certified Gold in the United States
    by the RIAA.</p>
      <p>In March and April 2009, VH1 ran a countdown of the 
    <i>100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 80s</i>. "Toy Soldiers"
    placed at #67 on the countdown despite the fact that Martika
    had three other Top 40 hits: "More Than You Know" (#18); "I
    Feel the Earth Move" (#25); and "Love ... Thy Will Be Done"
    (#10).</p>
      <p>In 
    <i>The Simpsons</i>18th season episode "G.I. (Annoyed Grunt)"
    the music playing during the assault course is "Toy
    Soldiers".</p>
