      <p>"If Wishes Came True" is a song recorded by the
    R&amp;B/dance group Sweet Sensation on their 1990 album 
    <i>Love Child</i>. It was the biggest hit of their career and
    hit number one in the U.S. on September 1, 1990, replacing
    Mariah Carey's "Vision of Love".</p>
      <p>The song begins with strings and a flamenco guitar, then
    quickly picks up into a synthesizer line and the singing begins
    soon afterward. The song reaches its greatest strength at the
    chorus. A power ballad, "If Wishes Came True" displayed a
    different side to the girl group, primarily known for their
    latin freestyle hits. Accordingly, the song also became Sweet
    Sensation's only entry on the Billboard Adult Contemporary
    singles chart, where it reached number eight.</p>
      <p>According to 
    <i>Billboard Book of Number One Hits</i>the members of the
    group cried for days after learning that their song had hit
    number one.</p>
