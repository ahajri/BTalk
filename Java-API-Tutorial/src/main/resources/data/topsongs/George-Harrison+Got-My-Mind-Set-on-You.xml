      <p>"Got My Mind Set on You" is a song written by Rudy Clark and
    originally recorded by James Ray in 1962.</p>
      <p>It is best known for the cover version released by George
    Harrison.</p>
      <p>A cover version by former Beatle George Harrison from his
    album 
    <i>Cloud Nine</i>reached number one on the Hot 100 in January
    1988. Produced by Harrison and former ELO member Jeff Lynne,
    the song was his third and last solo US number one, after "My
    Sweet Lord" in 1970 and "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)"
    in 1973. It was also the last number one single, to date, by
    any of the solo Beatles in the United States. As Harrison's
    third post-Beatles #1 hit in the U.S., he broke a three-way tie
    among himself, John Lennon and Ringo Starr as ex-Beatles with
    two #1 solo singles, and moved Harrison into second place
    behind Paul McCartney's nine #1 songs. Of Harrison's three
    number one singles in the U.S., it was the only song not
    written by Harrison and the only one without religious
    overtones. The single's B-side is "Lay His Head", written by
    Harrison. The 12" version of the single also adds an extended
    version of "Got My Mind Set On You".</p>
      <p>Two music videos were released for the cover version. The
    first (directed by Gary Weis) starred a young Alexis Denisof
    vying for the heart of a girl in an arcade. The second (also
    directed by Weis), is Harrison sitting and playing in a study.
    As the song progresses, furniture and knick-knacks (like a
    stuffed squirrel and mounted warthog) begin to dance along with
    the song. In the middle of the video, Harrison's stunt double
    performs a stunning backflip from his chair and follows with a
    dance routine before jumping back to his seat. The second
    received significant airplay, and was nominated for three MTV
    VMAs.</p>
      <p>In the UK the single spent four weeks at number two.</p>
      <p>Harrison's version of the song was parodied by "Weird Al"
    Yankovic on his 1988 album 
    <i>Even Worse</i>, as "(This Song's Just) Six Words Long".
    Shakin' Stevens recorded the song for his 2006 album 
    <i>Now Listen</i>.</p>
