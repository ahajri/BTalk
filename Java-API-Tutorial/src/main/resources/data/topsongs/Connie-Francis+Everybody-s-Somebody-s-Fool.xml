      <p>"Everybody's Somebody's Fool" is a song written by Jack
    Keller and Howard Greenfield which was a #1 hit for Connie
    Francis in the summer of 1960.</p>
      <p>Although "Everybody's Somebody's Fool" was written as a
    bluesy ballad, Francis envisioned the song as polka style
    number feeling that as such it would fare well in the German
    market and producer Arnold Maxin followed Francis' advisement
    in the 7 April 1960 session at Olmstead Studios (NYC) when
    Francis cut the song with the Joe Sherman Orchestra.</p>
      <p>In the US "Everybody's Somebody's Fool" was intended to
    serve as the B-side for the track "Jealous of You (Tango Della
    Gelosia)", which like Francis' precedent A-side hit "Mama" was
    a ballad of Italian origin; however most American radio
    stations preferred to play "Everybody's Somebody's Fool" and -
    while "Jealous of You" did reach #19 - "Everybody's Somebody's
    Fool" reached #1 on the Hot 100 on 27 June 1960 and remained
    there the following week. The first of Francis' three US #1's,
    "Everybody's Somebody's Fool" was also ranked on the R&amp;B
    chart at #2 and was the only one of Francis' major hits to
    cross over to the C&amp;W charts where it peaked at #24.</p>
      <p>A #5 hit in the UK, "Everybody's Somebody's Fool" was #1 in
    Australia for three weeks in July 1960 and in South Africa
    ranked as the #15 hit for that year.[1]</p>
      <p>Francis' instincts re the German hit potential of
    "Everybody's Somebody's Fool" proved correct: rendered as "Die
    Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel" became the best-selling single
    of 1960in Germany where the original English version of the
    song also reached #25 in Germany. "Everybody's Somebody's Fool"
    was also #1 in Norway for eight weeks. Translated versions of
    the song include those made by Celly Campello (in Portuguese as
    "Alguém é bobo de alguém"), Marketta Joutsi (in Finnish as
    "Pajunköyttä") and Siw Malmkvist (in Swedish as "Tunna
    skivor"). Subsequent to "Everybody's Somebody's Fool", Francis
    herself began to cut versions of all her single releases in
    several different languages.</p>
      <p>"Everybody's Somebody's Fool" was remade in 1979 by Debby
    Boone who had previously had Top 20 C&amp;W hits with her
    Connie Francis hit remakes "My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own" and
    "Breakin' in a Brand New Broken Heart"; however Boone's version
    of "Everybody's Somebody's Fool" only reached #48 C&amp;W. The
    song has also been an album cut for Lynn Anderson, Pat Boone,
    Ann Breen, Sierra Hull, Margo, Jody Miller, Marie Osmond, Sandy
    Posey and Bobby Vee.</p>
      <p>The song originally recorded by Connie Francis entitled
    "Everybody's Somebody's Fool" is often confused with an earlier
    song of the same title written by Ace Adams and Lionel Hampton
    which has been recorded by LaVern Baker, Michael Jackson, Etta
    James, the Heartbeats (#78/ 1957), Clyde McPhatter, Little
    Jimmy Scott, Kay Starr, Dakota Staton and Dinah Washington.</p>
      <p>The arrangement performed by Connie Francis is noted for its
    organ introduction. This is the only place in this arrangement
    featuring the organ.</p>
