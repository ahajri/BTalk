      <p>"I'm Leaving It All Up to You" is a popular song sung by
    Dale and Grace that was a number-one song in the United States
    in 1963 (see 1963 in music). It was the first time a hit by a
    duet was succeeded by another duet on the number-one spot. It
    topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the week ending November
    23, 1963 and remained there for two weeks.</p>
      <p>The song also spent two weeks atop the "Easy listening"
    chart that same year. This was the number one song on the date
    President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas.
    Interestingly, Dale and Grace were in Dallas, Texas, on the day
    of the assassination, scheduled to perform that night as part
    of Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars (with Bobby Rydell, Jimmy
    Clanton, and Brian Hyland), and had actually waved to the
    president's motorcade from a vantage point near their hotel
    moments before the assassination.</p>
      <p>The song was covered in 1970 by Linda Ronstadt on her
    Nashville recorded 
    <i>Silk Purse</i>album. It became a chart-topping hit again
    more than ten years later, when brother and sister duo Donny
    &amp; Marie Osmond covered the song in 1974. That September, it
    reached #4 on the Hot 100 and #1 Adult Contemporary chart in
    the United States.</p>
