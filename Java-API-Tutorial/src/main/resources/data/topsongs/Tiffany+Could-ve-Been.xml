      <p>"Could've Been" is the third single released from 
    <i>Tiffany</i>, the debut album of American teen-pop singer
    Tiffany.</p>
      <p>The song was discovered by Music Insiders Don McGovern and
    Brad Schmidt when they stumbled into a Hungry Tiger Restaurant
    in Thousound Oaks, California and heard a local performer,Lois
    Blaich singing the song. Then McGovern and Schmidt brought the
    song to Record Producer George Tobin and encouraged Tobin to
    record the song... The song is a slow ballad about the love
    that "could've been so beautiful, could've been so right". Both
    Tiffany's label, MCA Records, and her manager, George Tobin,
    felt concern that she was not old or mature enough to handle a
    song with such emotional depth. In the end, Tiffany convinced
    them that she could, and the song was recorded and put on her
    debut album, becoming its third single.</p>
      <p>The B-side to the single of "Could've Been" was the track
    "The Heart of Love".</p>
      <p>For the music video, music video stations played a live
    version of "Could've Been" where fans sang along to Tiffany's
    performance.</p>
      <p>"Could've Been" shot up the charts right away and in the
    U.S. became Tiffany's second consecutive number-one hit
    following "I Think We're Alone Now". The song was also a
    number-one hit on the adult contemporary chart as well as many
    other countries all over the world.</p>
