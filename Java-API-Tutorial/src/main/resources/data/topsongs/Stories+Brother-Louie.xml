      <p>"Brother Louie" is a song about an interracial love affair.
    The title was written and sung by Errol Brown and Tony Wilson
    of the group Hot Chocolate and was a top 10 UK chart hit for
    the band in 1973, produced by Mickie Most. Alexis Korner has a
    spoken word part in this version of the song.</p>
      <p>from the album 
    <i>About Us</i>
      </p>
      <p>The song was covered by an American band called Stories
    (featuring singer Ian Lloyd), about six months after Hot
    Chocolate's UK hit, and the Stories version made number one on
    the Billboard Hot 100 in the US. Another cover was made by Roy
    Ayers on his album "Virgo Red", playing vibes instead of
    singing.</p>
      <p>Recently, the song has been covered by the North Korean
    electronic orchestra, the Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble, Bon
    Jovi, and the hip hop group Code Red.</p>
      <p>It has been covered by many other artists, including The
    Undisputed Truth, Stories, The Quireboys, Beckett (Peter
    Beckett), Scarecrow, and Modern Talking.</p>
      <p>The recording by Stories was featured in the film "A Guide
    to Recognizing Your Saints" (2006).</p>
      <p>The Stories version appeared in an episode of the series 
    <i>Nip/Tuck</i>.</p>
      <p>An alternate rendition of the Stories version of the song
    has also been included in the soundtrack of the 2007 film 
    <i>Zodiac (film)</i>.</p>
      <p>The Stories version of "Brother Louie" is on the soundtrack
    to the 1995 film 
    <i>Dick</i>.</p>
