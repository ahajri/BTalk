      <p>"Help!" is a song by The Beatles that served as the title
    song for both the 1965 film and its soundtrack album. It was
    also released as a single, and was number one for three weeks
    in both the US and UK. "Help!" was written primarily by John
    Lennon, but credited (as were all Beatles songs written by
    either person) to Lennon/McCartney. Paul McCartney reports that
    he had a hand in writing the song as well, being called in "to
    complete it" in a two-hour joint writing session on 4 April
    1965 at Lennon's house in Weybridge. He later said that the
    title was "out of desperation". In 2004, "Help!" was ranked
    number 29 on 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>magazine's list of the 500 greatest songs
    of all time.</p>
      <p>The documentary series 
    <i>The Beatles Anthology</i>revealed that Lennon wrote the
    lyrics of the song to express his stress after The Beatles'
    quick rise to success. "I was fat and depressed and I 
    <i>was</i>crying out for 'Help'," Lennon told 
    <i>Playboy</i>. Writer Ian MacDonald describes the song as the
    "first crack in the protective shell" Lennon had built around
    his fragile emotions during The Beatles' rise to fame, and an
    important milestone in his songwriting style.</p>
      <p>In the 1970 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>"Lennon Remembers" interviews, Lennon said
    that because of its honesty it was one of his favourites among
    the Beatles songs he wrote, but he wished they had recorded it
    at a slower tempo. In these interviews, Lennon said he felt
    that "Help!" and "Strawberry Fields Forever" were his most
    genuine Beatles songs and not just songs written to order.
    According to Lennon's cousin and boyhood friend Stanley Parkes,
    however, "Help!" was written after Lennon "came in from the
    studio one night. 'God,' he said, 'they've changed the title of
    the film: it's going to be called 'Help!' now. So I've had to
    write a new song with the title called 'Help!'."</p>
      <p>The Beatles recorded "Help!" in 12 takes on 13 April 1965,
    in Abbey Road's Studio Two. They used four-track equipment and,
    when the four tracks proved insufficient, resorted for the
    first time to "bouncing", conducted twice to allow eight
    recorded tracks.</p>
      <p>The first eight takes were without vocals: the first three
    included George playing his descending guitar figure until,
    when takes kept breaking down, he admitted it was 'too fast' to
    play. Taking advice from George Martin it was decided to
    overdub the riff later, recording the sound of John's tapped
    acoustic guitar in the rhythm track take. By Take 12 the song
    was complete with overdubbed group vocals, tambourine and
    George's guitar fills.</p>
      <p>"Help!" went to #1 on both the UK and American singles
    charts in late summer 1965. It was the fourth of six number one
    singles in a row on the American charts; "I Feel Fine", "Eight
    Days a Week", "Ticket to Ride", "Help!", "Yesterday", and "We
    Can Work It Out". The record was equalled by The Bee Gees in
    the 1970s and surpassed by Mariah Carey in the 1990s. "Help!"
    marked a compositional turning point for the group, Lennon
    being the more dominant hit-single writer with five #1s
    culminating in "Help!", while McCartney afterwards produced
    eight #1s beginning with "Yesterday".</p>
      <p>The song appears on the 
    <i>Help!</i>LP, the USA 
    <i>Help!</i>soundtrack, 
    <i>1962-1966</i>(the American version begins with a James
    Bond-style instrumental), the 
    <i>Imagine</i>soundtrack, 
    <i>1</i>, 
    <i>Love</i>, and 
    <i>The Capitol Albums, Vol. 2</i>. The single and album
    versions of the song have slight differences: the original mono
    version, appearing on The Beatles' 
    <i>Rarities</i>LP as well as on mono versions of the original
    LP release, has a different lead vocal by Lennon and no
    tambourine.</p>
