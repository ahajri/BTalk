      <p>"Stuck with You" is the title of a hit single by Huey Lewis
    and the News, written by guitarist Chris Hayes and lead singer
    Huey Lewis, from 1986. It was the first single from the band's
    fourth album, 
    <i>Fore!</i>. The song spent three weeks at number one on the
    Billboard Hot 100 from September 20, 1986, through October 10,
    1986. The single was the band's second number-one hit on the
    Hot 100 chart, following "The Power of Love" in 1985. The song
    reached number 12 on the UK Singles Chart.</p>
      <p>The music video for "Stuck with You" was filmed in the
    Bahamas and features Keely Shaye Smith. The island that Lewis
    and Smith wind up on is a small island about ten miles from
    Paradise Island in Nassau. The video was filmed on land, on
    water, underwater and from the air. The band, the crew and all
    the extras used in the island BBQ scene had to stay on a barge
    moored off the island so that they wouldn't be seen.</p>
      <p>The video was directed by Edd Griles, who had previously
    directed the band's video for "The Heart of Rock &amp; Roll" as
    well as Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" and "Time
    After Time".</p>
