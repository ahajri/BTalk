      <p>"Leaving on a Jet Plane" is a song written by John Denver in
    1966 and most famously recorded by Peter, Paul and Mary. The
    original title of the song was "Oh Babe I Hate To Go" but
    Denver's then producer, Milt Okun, convinced him to change the
    title. The song was initially recorded in 1967 by the Chad
    Mitchell Trio, and later that same year by Spanky and Our Gang.
    Peter, Paul and Mary's version first appeared on their 1967 
    <i>Album 1700</i>; however, it did not become a hit until they
    released it as a single in 1969. It turned out to be their
    biggest (and final) hit, becoming their only #1 on the
    Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States. It was the second
    to last #1 single of the 1960's. The song also spent three
    weeks atop the easy listening chart.</p>
      <p>John Denver's version of his song, "Leaving on a Jet Plane",
    was included on his 1969 debut solo album, 
    <i>Rhymes and Reasons</i>. Many other artists have covered this
    song, including:</p>
