      <p>"You Send Me" is a 1957 single by R&amp;B singer-songwriter
    Sam Cooke. The song was his first secular single released
    through Keen Records, an imprint of RCA Victor Records. (His
    first non-gospel single, "Lovable," was released earlier that
    year under a pseudonym.) Released in September 1957, the record
    became an instant hit, topping the charts on both the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Pop and R&amp;B singles charts. The record
    established Cooke as a mainstream R&amp;B singer, apart from
    his gospel roots.</p>
      <p>At the same time a rendition was also released by Teresa
    Brewer, which reached #8 on the pop charts.</p>
      <p>Since its release, the song has become a landmark record of
    the soul genre, which Cooke helped create. It was named as one
    of the 500 most important rock and roll recordings by the Rock
    &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. In 2005, the song was voted #115 by
    representatives of the music industry and press in 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>magazine's 
    <i>The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time</i>.</p>
      <p>The song has been covered by a number of artists, including
    Nat King Cole, The Drifters, The Everly Brothers, Jos√©
    Feliciano, Aretha Franklin, The Supremes, Otis Redding, Sam
    &amp; Dave, Percy Sledge, Van Morrison, Steven Houghton and the
    Steve Miller Band. In the United Kingdom, Rod Stewart released
    this song as part of a medley with "Bring It on Home to Me" and
    charted it on the UK Singles Chart at #7 as a double A-side
    with "Farewell". The Dixie Chicks released their version of the
    song on their 1992 independent release, "Little Ol'
    Cowgirl".</p>
