      <p>"You Should Be Dancing" is a single by the Bee Gees, from
    the album, 
    <i>Children of the World</i>, in 1976. The single hit number
    one for one week on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, number one for
    seven weeks on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart, and in July
    the same year, reached number five on the UK Singles Chart. The
    song also peaked at number four on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>R&amp;B chart. It was this song that first
    launched the Bee Gees into disco stardom, although
    rock-oriented drums and guitars can be heard in the background.
    It was also the only track from the group to top the dance
    chart.</p>
      <p>The song was their third 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot 100 number-one and their sixth number-one
    in Canada. It ended up the year as the #31 song of the year on
    the Hot 100. It also hit number four in Ireland. In Australia,
    where the brothers spent a number of years in their youth, it
    managed only to nick the top 20.</p>
      <p>"You Should Be Dancing" is known today as the first
    chart-topper in which Barry Gibb uses his now-trademark
    falsetto (he had previously used it on the top-10 "Nights on
    Broadway" and on "Fanny (Be Tender With My Love)"). The song
    was prominently featured in the movie 
    <i>Saturday Night Fever</i>and appears on its soundtrack
    album.</p>
      <p>Live performances of "You Should Be Dancing" during the 1979
    
    <i>Spirits Having Flown</i>tour featured the Bee Gees' younger
    sibling, Andy Gibb, on backing vocals.</p>
      <p>This song and the scene from the movie containing the song
    were seen and heard in the film 
    <i>Short Circuit</i>.</p>
      <p>The Boston Celtics also play this song when they are about
    to win a basketball game accompanied by the ever popular
    "Dancing Gino" video from the television show 
    <i>American Bandstand</i>.</p>
      <p>Blockster released a cover "You Should Be...", which reached
    number three in the UK chart in January 1999.</p>
      <p>Blake Lewis, the runner-up on the sixth season of 
    <i>American Idol</i>, performed the song on the show on May 8,
    2007. His studio version was later released on the official
    website and on 
    <i>American Idol Season 6: The Collector's Edition</i>, a
    compilation of studio versions of songs performed by 
    <i>Idol</i>finalists.</p>
