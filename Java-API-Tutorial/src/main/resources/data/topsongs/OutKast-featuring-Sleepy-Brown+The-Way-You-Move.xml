      <p>"The Way You Move" is a 2003 number-one single recorded by
    Big Boi of the hip-hop duo OutKast, released on LaFace Records.
    The song features OutKast mentor Sleepy Brown on guest vocals.
    It and "Hey Ya!", recorded by André 3000, the other member of
    the duo, were released as the first singles from OutKast's
    double album project 
    <i>Speakerboxxx/The Love Below</i>, which includes a solo album
    from each member. Released from Big Boi's 
    <i>Speakerboxxx</i>half of the double-album, "The Way You Move"
    peaked at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming
    OutKast's third number-one single. In 2009 it was named the
    22nd most successful song of the 2000s, on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot 100 Songs of the Decade.</p>
      <p>"The Way You Move" is credited to Big Boi, Sleepy Brown, and
    the song's producer, Carlton Mahone; Big Boi also does some
    co-production. Combining elements of bass music, Atlanta-style
    southern hip hop, and 1970s soul music, "The Way You Move" is
    Big Boi's light-hearted dedication to women. The song's
    instrumental track is punctuated with the prominent live horn
    section "Hornz Unlimited" of Atlanta reminiscent of Earth Wind
    and Fire, and the chorus and bridge feature Sleepy Brown
    singing in style inspired by the work of Motown star Marvin
    Gaye.</p>
      <p>The song's music video, directed by Bryan Barber, features
    Big Boi as the proprietor of a rim shop. The video's
    performance shots eventually gravitate to other locations
    during the video's running time, featuring several young women
    who Big Boi, dressed in a pimp's suit, attempts to pick up. The
    video features an appearance from Fonzworth Bentley and another
    from actress Ki Toy Johnson.</p>
      <p>"The Way You Move" music video was designed to be shown in
    tandem with the video for André 3000's "Hey Ya!". A long-form
    "The Way You Move/Hey Ya!" video combines both clips with a
    bridging sequence.</p>
      <p>"The Way You Move" spent eight weeks at the number-two
    position behind "Hey Ya!" before finally replacing it at number
    one on the Billboard Hot 100 on February 7, 2004, where it
    stayed for one week. That was the sixth time a recording act
    has replaced itself on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>pop chart. "The Way You Move" was ranked number
    five on the 2004 Billboard Year-End Chart. On the Hot
    R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks chart, "The Way You Move"
    peaked at number two (seven positions higher than "Hey Ya!"),
    and reached the top of the Hot Rap Tracks chart.</p>
      <p>In 2004, Saxophonist Kenny G and Funk legends Earth, Wind,
    &amp; Fire released a cover of the song "The Way You Move" with
    Philip Bailey and Maurice White on vocals. The song appears on
    Kenny G's 
    <i>At Last... The Duets Album</i>and Earth, Wind, &amp; Fire's
    2005 album 
    <i>Illumination</i>The song went to number 12 on the Adult
    Contemporary Chart.</p>
