      <p>"Frenesi" is a musical piece originally composed by Alberto
    Dominguez for the marimba, and adapted as a jazz standard by
    Leonard Whitcup and others. A hit version recorded by Artie
    Shaw (with an arrangement by William Grant Still) reached
    number one on the pop chart on December 21, 1940. Other
    performers who have recorded the song include Cliff Richard,
    Harry James, Tommy Dorsey, Glenn Miller, Dave Brubeck, June
    Christy, The Four Freshmen, Anita O'Day, Betty Carter, Woody
    Herman, Les Brown, Perez Prado, Linda Ronstadt, Eydie Gorme and
    Frank Sinatra. Thomas Pynchon's 1990 novel Vineland features a
    character named Frenesi Gates.</p>
      <p>The word "frenesi" is the Spanish equivalent of
    "frenzy".</p>
      <p>Major Thomas Hayes, WWII flying Ace named his P-51 "Frenesi"
    after the song. He said it was a tribute to his wife Marie, for
    the song they listened to. He believed the song's name
    translated to "Love me Tenderly".</p>
