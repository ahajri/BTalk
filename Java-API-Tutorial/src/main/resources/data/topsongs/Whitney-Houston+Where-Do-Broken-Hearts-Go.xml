      <p>"Where Do Broken Hearts Go" is the fourth single from
    Whitney Houston's second album, 
    <i>Whitney</i>. The ballad was released in March 1988. The song
    was written by Frank Wildhorn and Chuck Jackson.</p>
      <p>Initially, Houston did not want to record the song, feeling
    there was no special message to convey. However, Arista Records
    CEO Clive Davis believed the song would go to number one if she
    recorded it, so she agreed. The single became Houston's seventh
    consecutive number one.</p>
      <p>Houston was already in a three-way tie with The Beatles and
    the Bee Gees; all three acts with six consecutive number-one
    singles in the U.S. "Where Do Broken Hearts Go" gave her a
    record-breaking seven consecutive number-one singles, holding
    down the top spot for two weeks from April 23 to May 7,
    1988.</p>
      <p>The song also topped both component charts, the Billboard
    Hot 100 Single Sales and Hot 100 Airplay and remained in the
    top forty for thirteen weeks. On other Billboard charts, the
    song fared well, reaching number one for three weeks on the
    Adult Contemporary chart and number two on the R&amp;B chart.
    The song was ranked #33 on Billboard's year end chart in 1988
    and #2 on its year end Adult Contemporary chart.</p>
      <p>The song also became a top twenty hit in the United Kingdom
    and fared moderately in Australia, reaching number
    forty-eight.</p>
      <p>The music video (directed by Peter Israelson) features
    Houston breaking up with a boyfriend and reflecting on happy
    memories; asking herself the title question, "where do broken
    hearts go?" At the conclusion of the music video, the couple
    reunites.</p>
      <p>"Where Do Broken Hearts Go" has been covered by punk rock
    group Me First &amp; The Gimme Gimmes on their 2003 album, 
    <i>Take a Break</i>..and more recently by Joe McElderry on The
    X Factor 2009. The song has also been covered by Tracy Miller,
    a Broadway theatrical actress-singer, who performed the song at
    a "Frank Wildhorn &amp; Friends" concert.</p>
      <p>"Where Do Broken Hearts Go" was ranked thirty-third on The
    Billboard Hot 100 Year-End Charts (1988), and stayed on the
    chart for seventeen weeks. It was Houston's record-setting
    seventh consecutive number-one single on The Billboard Hot 100,
    sixth on the Hot 100 Single Sales chart, fifth on the Hot 100
    Airplay chart, and sixth on Adult Contemporary chart.</p>
