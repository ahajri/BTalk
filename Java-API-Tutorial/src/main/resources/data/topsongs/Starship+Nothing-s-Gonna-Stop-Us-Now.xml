      <p>"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now" is a song co-written by Albert
    Hammond and Diane Warren, recorded by Starship. Featured as the
    theme to the romantic comedy film 
    <i>Mannequin</i>, it hit #1 in the Billboard Hot 100 on April
    4, 1987 and reached #1 on the UK Singles Chart for four weeks
    the following month and became the UK's 2nd biggest selling
    single of 1987. At the time, it made Grace Slick the oldest
    female artist to have a number one single in the United States,
    though the record was later broken by Cher's "Believe" in 1999.
    The song also received an Oscar nomination for "Best Original
    Song" at the 60th Academy Awards. It was released on the album 
    <i>No Protection</i>in 1987.</p>
      <p>In a radio interview, Albert Hammond said that the idea for
    the song came from his impending marriage to his live-in
    girlfriend of 7 years, after his divorce from his previous wife
    was finalized. He had said to Diane Warren, "It's almost like
    they've stopped me from marrying this woman for seven years,
    and they haven't succeeded. They're not gonna stop me doing
    it."</p>
