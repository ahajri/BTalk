      <p>"Sailing" is a number-one single, written and performed by
    Christopher Cross on his 1979 eponymous debut album. The song
    was a phenomenal success, winning Grammy Awards for Song of the
    Year, Arrangement of the Year, and helping Cross win the Best
    New Artist award. VH1 named this the greatest "softsational
    soft rock" music song of all time. The lyrics describe the joys
    of sailing.</p>
      <p>It was a number-one rated single in the United States. Since
    its debut, it has been covered by many artists, including
    Avant, Barry Manilow, Big Bub, 'N Sync, and Phajja.</p>
      <p>The song was one of the first digitally recorded songs,
    utilizing the 3M digital recording system.</p>
      <p>The Mexican airline AeroMéxico used the theme during the
    middle 1980s as a jingle for its advertisements; it was also
    used for the cigarette brand Winston.</p>
      <p>Dr. Octagon refers to the lyrics in the song "Blue Flowers
    Revisited" on the album 
    <i>Dr. Octagonecologyst</i>.</p>
      <p>Tracy Morgan referenced the song "Sailing" when he appeared
    on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart on Feb 24th, 2010. Tracy
    stated that if he had a variety show he would book Christopher
    Cross to sing Sailing with a russian bear on a bicycle. Cross
    would be wearing a Houston Oilers jersey and playing a
    double-axe bass guitar. Morgan then talked about how he used to
    cry when he would hear Cross sing the song and noted that it
    was his "vision" to have Cross sing with the bear riding the
    bicycle.</p>
