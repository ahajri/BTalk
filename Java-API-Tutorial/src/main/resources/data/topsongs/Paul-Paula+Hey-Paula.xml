      <p>"Hey Paula" is a song recorded by Paul &amp; Paula. It hit
    number one on the Billboard Hot 100 on the week ending February
    9, 1963, and also made it to number one on the Hot R&amp;B
    Singles chart.. "Paul" was the song's writer, Ray
    Hildebrand[1], a student at Howard Payne College in Brownwood,
    Texas. "Paula" was Jill Jackson, the niece of the owner of the
    boarding house where Ray lived.</p>
      <p>Hildebrand wrote the song, originally titled "Paul and
    Paula", taking inspiration from the Annette Funicello hit Tall
    Paul. Hildebrand and Jackson performed the song on a local
    radio station and the song soon became popular enough for the
    duo to try to make a professional recording. They went to a
    studio in Fort Worth, Texas, and were fortunate enough to find
    a producer, Major Bill Smith, with studio time and musicians
    booked and a missing lead vocalist. He recorded their version
    of the song and released it on his LeCam Records label,
    changing the name to "Hey Paula", credited to Jill and Ray.
    When the record became a success, it was picked up by the
    larger Philips Records, which changed the billing to Paul and
    Paula.</p>
      <p>When the song was released on Phillips, it hit the national
    charts in late 1962, reaching number one on both the pop and
    R&amp;B charts in 1963. It spawned a follow-up top ten hit,
    "Young Lovers", and a series of other hits for the duo.</p>
