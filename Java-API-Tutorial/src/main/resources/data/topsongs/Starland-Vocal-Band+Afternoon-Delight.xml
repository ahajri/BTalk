      <p>"Afternoon Delight" is a 1976 song by the Starland Vocal
    Band, written by Bill Danoff, featuring close harmony and
    sexually suggestive lyrics. It became a number-one U.S.
    Billboard Hot 100 single on July 10, 1976. The song has been
    inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</p>
      <p>Concurrent to the Starland Vocal Band's version, country
    singer Johnny Carver had a Top 10 version of his own on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot Country Singles chart.</p>
      <p>In the 1990s and 2000s, "Afternoon Delight" was featured in
    several film and television shows, albeit often in an ironic
    sense, such as 
    <i>Get a Life</i>(Chris Wins a Celebrity), 
    <i>Good Will Hunting</i>, 
    <i>PCU</i>, 
    <i>Boogie Nights</i>, 
    <i>The Rules of Attraction</i>, 
    <i>The Spirit of '76</i>, 
    <i>Starsky &amp; Hutch</i>, 
    <i>Arrested Development</i>(as part of a plot point in the
    episode "Afternoon Delight"), 
    <i>The Simpsons</i>("The Fat and the Furriest"), 
    <i>Rules of Engagement</i>, 
    <i>Sports Night</i>
         <i>Complete Savages</i>, 
    <i>South Park</i>and 
    <i>Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy</i>; it was featured
    prominently in a 1991 episode of 
    <i>Murphy Brown</i>, where a number of the characters flashed
    back to the Bicentennial Celebration in 1976. In 1983, The
    Circle Jerks also covered this song as one of the six cover
    versions on "Golden Shower of Hits (Jerks on 45)", which
    appears on their third album with the same title. A British
    experimental folk music band Current 93 used an
    industrial-style cover version as an introduction to their
    performances of their 2009 album.</p>
      <p>The name for the song comes from the name of a special menu
    of the same name at Clyde's restaurant in Georgetown.</p>
