      <p>"Tangerine" is a popular song. The music was written by
    Victor Schertzinger, the lyrics by Johnny Mercer. The song was
    published in 1941.</p>
      <p>It was introduced in the 1942 movie, 
    <i>The Fleet's In</i>, produced by Paramount Pictures, directed
    by Schertzinger, and starring Dorothy Lamour, William Holden,
    Eddie Bracken, singer Cass Daley, and Betty Hutton in her
    feature film debut.</p>
      <p>The most popular recorded version of the song was made by
    the Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra with vocalists Helen O'Connell and
    Bob Eberly. The recording was released by Decca Records as
    catalog number 4123. The record first reached the 
    <i>Billboard</i>charts on April 10, 1942 and lasted 15 weeks on
    the chart, peaking at #1. A disco instrumental version by the
    Salsoul Orchestra revived the song, bringing it into the top
    twenty in 1976.</p>
      <p>Herb Alpert &amp; The Tijuana Brass recorded a
    leisurely-paced version of the song for their album 
    <i>Whipped Cream &amp; Other Delights</i>.</p>
      <p>The tune was featured as background music in the movie 
    <i>Star Trek III: The Search for Spock.</i>
      </p>
      <p>The Pet Milk company used the melody for a 1960s liquid diet
    product called Sego. The opening line "Tangerine, she is all
    they say" was replaced by "There she goes, she's a Sego girl."
    The tune later became the jingle for Pillsbury's Figurines, a
    diet aid, during the 1970s.</p>
