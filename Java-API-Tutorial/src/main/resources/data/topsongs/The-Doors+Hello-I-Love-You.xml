      <p>"Hello, I Love You" is a song by The Doors from their 1968
    album 
    <i>Waiting for the Sun</i>. It was released as a single that
    same year, reaching number one in the United States and selling
    over a million copies in the U.S. alone. The single also became
    the band's first big UK hit, peaking at number fifteen on the
    chart.</p>
      <p>This was one of the six songs performed by The Doors on the
    demo for Aura Records in 1965.</p>
      <p>Some pressings of the single list the title as "Hello, I
    Love You (Won't You Tell Me Your Name?)".</p>
      <p>In the liner notes to The Doors Box set, Robbie Krieger has
    denied the allegations that the song's musical structure was
    stolen from Ray Davies, where a riff similar to it is featured
    in the song "All Day and All of the Night". Instead, he said
    the song's vibe was taken from Cream's song "Sunshine of Your
    Love".</p>
      <p>The last verse was written by Jim Morrison three years prior
    to the album recordings, while he was observing an attractive
    African American girl at Venice Beach.</p>
      <p>"Sidewalk crouches at her feet, Like a dog that begs for
    something sweet., Do you hope to make her see you, fool?, Do
    you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?",</p>
      <p>The song has been covered by Oleander, Alex Nautical, Buddy
    Rich, Missing Persons, The Cure (on the compilation 
    <i>Rubaiyat</i>, 1990), Rhythmical, Simple Minds, Anal Cunt,
    Neil Young, Adam Ant, Adam Freeland, Program the Dead, Siouxie
    Sioux and Lithuanian postmodernist rock band Antis .</p>
      <p>It is also referenced in The Dresden Dolls' song "The
    Perfect Fit" and Pulp's "Dogs Are Everywhere". Hip Hop artist
    Nero mixed and released this tune as "You Ho".</p>
      <p>Grindcore band Anal Cunt had a cover of this song as a
    hidden track on their Morbid Florist EP.</p>
