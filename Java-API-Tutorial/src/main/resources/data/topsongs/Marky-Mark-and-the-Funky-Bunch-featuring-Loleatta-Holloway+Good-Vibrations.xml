      <p>"Good Vibrations" is a 1991 dance song by Marky Mark and the
    Funky Bunch from the album 
    <i>Music for the People</i>, and was released at the end of
    1991. The song became a number-one hit in Sweden, Switzerland,
    and the U.S.</p>
      <p>"Good Vibrations" was written by Amir "MC SPICE" Shakir, a
    good friend of Donnie Wahlberg, Mark Wahlberg, and Dan Hartman.
    The rapper/songwriter also wrote and produced "Wild Side" for
    Mark Wahlberg's debut LP as well as three other songs. Spice is
    featured on the song "Peace" with Mark and the crew and has
    contributed to the second LP by the Hollywood film star.</p>
      <p>It has no connection to the Beach Boys song of the same
    title. The song includes portions of Loleatta Holloway's track
    "Love Sensation"; she is credited as a featured artist on this
    single. "Good Vibrations" is the only number one song for both
    Marky Mark and Loleatta Holloway.</p>
      <p>The black and white video featured a young, 20-year-old
    Marky Mark working out and boxing with his nude torso, and
    making out with a girl on a bed. The video made famous his
    sexy, well-toned body, which impressed many and was considered
    the main attribute that made Mark one of the sex symbols of the
    early Nineties.</p>
      <p>It was included in the 1992 hit Disney movie, 
    <i>The Mighty Ducks</i>, as well as the 1999 movie 
    <i>Analyze This</i>. In 2007, the song was used in 
    <i>Blades of Glory</i>during a routine by the characters Stranz
    and Fairchild. In addition, there is a scene in the 
    <i>30 Rock</i>episode "Do-Over" where it is played in the
    background.</p>
