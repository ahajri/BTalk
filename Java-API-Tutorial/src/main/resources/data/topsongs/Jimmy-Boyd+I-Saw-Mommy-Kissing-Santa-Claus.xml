      <p>"I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus" is a Christmas song with
    music and lyrics by Tommie Connor.</p>
      <p>The original recording by Jimmy Boyd reached number one on
    the 
    <i>Billboard</i>charts in 1952, and on the 
    <i>Cash Box</i>chart at the beginning of the following year.
    The song was commissioned by Neiman Marcus to promote the
    store's Christmas card for the year, which featured an original
    sketch by artist Perry Barlow, who drew for 
    <i>The New Yorker</i>for many decades.</p>
      <p>Jimmy Boyd's record was condemned by the Roman Catholic
    Church in Boston when it was released on the grounds it mixed
    kissing with Christmas, ignoring the fact that mistletoe, under
    which many couples kiss, is traditionally hung on many ceilings
    at Christmas. Boyd, age thirteen, was photographed meeting with
    the Archdiocese to explain the song. After the meeting, the ban
    was lifted.</p>
      <p>The song describes a scene where a child creeps down from
    his bedroom to see his mother kissing "Santa Claus" (presumably
    his father dressed in a Santa Claus costume) underneath the
    mistletoe.</p>
      <p>Popular versions of the song were done by the Ronettes and
    the Jackson 5. John Mellencamp and the Secret Chiefs 3 have
    also covered it.</p>
