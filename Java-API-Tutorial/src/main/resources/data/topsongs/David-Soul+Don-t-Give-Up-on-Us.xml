      <p>"Don't Give Up on Us" is a song by David Soul.</p>
      <p>Riding high on the success of playing in the hit TV show 
    <i>Starsky and Hutch</i>, Soul returned to one of his early
    career choices as a singer. His debut, the Tony Macaulay
    written and produced "Don't Give Up on Us" was a worldwide
    smash, spending four weeks at #1 on the UK Singles Chart in
    January and February 1977 and a single week at #1 on the
    Billboard Hot 100 in April 1977. In addition, the song spent
    one week at #1 on the U.S. adult contemporary chart.</p>
      <p>"Don't Give Up on Us" was rated #93 in VH1's 
    <i>100 Greatest One-hit Wonders</i>(though Soul had several
    more hits, including a second no.1, in the UK). Soul recorded a
    new version of the song in 2004, allegedly after being
    embarrassed when hearing it by chance in an elevator as sung by
    Owen Wilson in the film version of 
    <i>Starsky and Hutch</i>.</p>
      <p>Zsa Zsa Padilla revived this in 1998, making it the first
    Filipino revival. Piolo Pascual also covered this song for the
    soundtrack of the same movie title in the Philippines.</p>
