      <p>"Bump n' Grind" is a song written, produced and performed by
    R&amp;B musician R. Kelly. It was the second single released
    from his first solo album 
    <i>12 Play</i>in 1994. The track became Kelly's only number one
    single on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 (temporarily interrupting
    the six-week run of Ace of Base's "The Sign") as a solo artist,
    and it also spent twelve weeks at number one on the U.S. Hot
    R&amp;B Songs chart, becoming the longest-running number-one
    U.S. R&amp;B single at that time. The song also reached number
    eight in the UK charts, following the massive success of his
    previous single, "She's Got That Vibe" (which was actually a
    re-release).</p>
      <p>The song is featured in the movies 
    <i>Without A Paddle</i>and 
    <i>The Wackness</i>.</p>
      <p>In 2008, it was featured in "Grand Theft Auto IV's"
    fictional Soul/R&amp;B radio station The Vibe 98.8.</p>
