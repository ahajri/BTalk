      <p>"I Shot the Sheriff" is a song written by Bob Marley, told
    from the point of view of a man who admits to having killed the
    local sheriff, but claims to be falsely accused of having
    killed the deputy sheriff. The song was first released on The
    Wailers' album 
    <i>Burnin'</i>.</p>
      <p>Eric Clapton recorded a cover version that was included on
    his album, 
    <i>461 Ocean Boulevard</i>. It is the most successful version
    of the song, peaking at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming
    Clapton's only chart-topping hit in the U.S.</p>
      <p>During the controversy over the Body Count song "Cop
    Killer", it was frequently pointed out that there were no
    similar complaints about Marley's song even though they had
    similar themes.</p>
      <p>On EPMD's 1988 "Strictly Business" LP, the title track uses
    a sample of "I Shot the Sheriff" (Clapton's Version).</p>
      <p>In Mary J. Blige's 1992 debut album ("What's the 411?"),
    Grand Puba declared 
    <i>"I shot the sheriff but I dint shoot no deputy"</i>in the
    title track.</p>
      <p>In 1997, rapper/producer Warren G covered the song for his 
    <i>Take a Look over Your Shoulder (Reality)</i>album. This
    version peaked at #20 on the Hot 100. It hit #1 in New
    Zealand.</p>
      <p>In 2000, the song has been covered in a ska-punk version by
    Voodoo Glow Skulls on their album 
    <i>Symbolic</i>. It was also covered by former 
    <i>American Idol</i>contestant Jason Castro in 2008.</p>
      <p>In 2004, Tom Morello, under his persona, The Nightwatchman,
    borrowed and changed lyrics from the song during his
    performance of Until the End, as part of the Axis of Justice
    Concert Series Volume 1. The lyrics he used were: "...three
    times I shot the sheriff; and did not spare the deputy". A
    studio version of the song was later released on his album One
    Man Revolution.</p>
