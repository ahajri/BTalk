      <p>"One Bad Apple" was a single released by The Osmonds in
    December 1970. The single hit number-one on Billboard's Hot 100
    Chart in February 1971 and stayed there for five weeks, and
    also reached number six on the R&amp;B charts .</p>
      <p>The song was written by George Jackson who originally had
    the Jackson 5 in mind when he wrote it. He also wrote the
    single "Double Lovin'" for the Osmonds. Both "One Bad Apple"
    and the Donny Osmond-credited single "Sweet and Innocent" are
    on the 1971 album "
    <i>Osmonds</i>". Singer Aaron Carter covered the song on his
    debut album Aaron Carter, in 1997.</p>
      <p>According to Donny Osmond, Michael Jackson later told him
    that the Jackson 5 almost recorded this song first, but chose
    to record "ABC" instead.</p>
      <p>The song was revived in the mid 80s by UK singer Nolan
    Thomas.</p>
