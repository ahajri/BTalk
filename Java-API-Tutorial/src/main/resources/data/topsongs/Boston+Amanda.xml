      <p>"Amanda" is a popular song by the American rock band Boston.
    "Amanda" features a mix of acoustic and electric guitars
    forming a love ballad, a type of song Boston doesn't typically
    perform. It also ended up being Boston's biggest hit single on
    the Billboard Hot 100, reaching number one for two weeks in
    November 1986. The song was written in 1980, and appeared on
    their 1986 album 
    <i>Third Stage</i>.</p>
      <p>Amanda is a relatively rare example of a song that reached
    #1 on the Top 100 in or after the 1980s without having a
    performance music video made for it. An interview for British
    television, made while the band was promoting the 
    <i>Third Stage</i>album, does show a couple of minutes of a
    music video near the end. The band does not appear in that
    video, which intersperses shots of a model smiling for the
    camera with special effects footage of the band's spaceship
    logo flying over the Boston skyline. One shot shows the
    animated spaceship almost colliding with the John Hancock
    Tower.</p>
