      <p>"How You Remind Me" is a single from rock band Nickelback's
    2001 album, 
    <i>Silver Side Up</i>. A "Gold Mix" was made for latter
    editions of the single with the heavier guitars edited out of
    the chorus. This single would be the last rock single to be #1
    on the Hot 100 until Maroon 5's song "Makes Me Wonder" went to
    #1 six years later. Lead vocalist and guitarist Chad Kroeger
    wrote the song about his old girlfriend Jodi, with whom he had
    a dysfunctional relationship. He refers to this song as the
    song that put Nickelback on the map as referred to their
    concert in Sturgis. It is often considered to be the band's
    signature song.</p>
      <p>"How You Remind Me" was named the #1 most played song on
    U.S. radio of the decade by Nielsen Soundscan, being spun over
    1.2 million times on U.S. airwaves since its release in 2001.
    The song was named 4th on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot 100 Songs of the Decade.</p>
      <p>The single was also released in that year, reaching the top
    of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles Chart for 4 weeks while
    it topped both the Mainstream and Modern Rock charts for 13
    weeks. Outside the U.S., the song became a worldwide hit, it
    was #4 on the UK Singles Chart, and #1 on the Irish Singles
    Chart. Due to the high sales, it was ranked as the top single
    of 2002 by 
    <i>Billboard</i>magazine.</p>
      <p>The song went on to rack up four Grammy Award nominations,
    four Billboard Awards, four Juno awards, and countless radio
    accreditations. "How You Remind Me" was the #1 Most Played Song
    of 2002 in the United States, across all formats, according to 
    <i>Billboard</i>Monitor.</p>
      <p>"How You Remind Me" was the #1 song on the 
    <i>Billboard'</i>s 2002 Year-End Hot 100 Singles Chart, Hot 100
    Airplay Track Chart and Hot Top 40 Track.</p>
      <p>VH1 ranked the song as the 16th Greatest Power Ballad.</p>
      <p>The song was listed at #36 on 
    <i>Billboard's All Time Top 100.</i>[1]</p>
      <p>The song also hit #1 on the 
    <i>Kerrang!</i>feature, 21st Century's Official 100 Rock Best
    Sellers, beating its fellow Nickelback's hit, "Rockstar", to
    the number-one spot.</p>
      <p>The song was the 75th best-selling single of the 2000s in
    the UK.</p>
      <p>The successful music video for "How You Remind Me" featured
    Nickelback playing a small venue with focus on a female
    audience member. Chad Kroeger admitted to disliking the idea of
    a small venue performance at first, opting for a bigger scale
    arena concert; however, he found the outcome of the video
    satisfying.</p>
      <p>In the music video, Chad Kroeger plays a man whose
    girlfriend (played by model Annie Henley) has left him and is
    still haunted by her memory. He still feels strongly for her,
    and sees her everywhere he goes. Whenever he imagines her
    touch, he feels a warm memory, indicated by the change in
    lighting in the video. As the music video progresses, he starts
    to get over her. At the end, she shows up and apparently asks
    him to forgive her. This is what he had wanted all along, but
    suddenly he realizes that it isn't really what he wanted, and
    pushes her away. She is left with a broken heart and haunted by
    memories, as he had been at the beginning of the video.</p>
