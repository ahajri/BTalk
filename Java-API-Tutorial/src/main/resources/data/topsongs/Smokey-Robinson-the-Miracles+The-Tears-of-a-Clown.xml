      <p>"The Tears of a Clown" is a 1967 song by Smokey Robinson
    &amp; the Miracles for the Tamla (Motown) label, originally
    released on the 1967 album 
    <i>Make It Happen</i>. The song was re-released in the United
    Kingdom as a single in September 1970, where it became a
    number-one hit on the UK singles chart. Subsequently, Motown
    released "The Tears of a Clown" as a single in the United
    States as well, where it quickly became a number-one hit on the
    Billboard Hot 100 and R&amp;B Singles Chart..This song is an
    international multi-million seller and a 2002 Grammy Hall of
    Fame inductee. The single's success caused Miracles lead
    singer/producer/songwriter Smokey Robinson, who had announced
    plans to leave the act, to stay with the group until 1972.</p>
      <p>Stevie Wonder and his producer Hank Cosby wrote the music
    for the song, and Cosby produced the instrumental track
    recording. Contrary to popular belief, the track was not a
    Christmas present from Stevie Wonder. Instead, Wonder brought
    the instrumental track to the 1966 Motown Christmas party
    because he could not come up with a song to fit the
    instrumental. Wonder wanted to see what Robinson could come up
    with for the track. Robinson, who remarked that the song's
    distinctive calliope motif "sounded like a circus", provided
    lyrics that reflected his vision and sang lead vocal. In the
    song, Robinson's character, sad because he did not have a woman
    who loved him, compares himself to the characters in the opera 
    <i>Pagliacci</i>, comedians/clowns who hide their hurt and
    anger behind empty smiles. Robinson had used the 
    <i>Pagliacci</i>comparison before: the line "just like
    Pagliacci did/I'll try to keep my sadness hid" also appears in
    the song "My Smile Is Just A Frown (Turned Upside Down)", which
    Robinson wrote in 1964 for Motown artist Carolyn Crawford.</p>
      <p>Issued as an album track on the 
    <i>Make It Happen</i>LP, "The Tears of a Clown" was not
    released as a single. By 1969, Robinson had tired of endlessly
    touring with the Miracles, and wanted to remain home in
    Detroit, Michigan with his wife Claudette and their two
    children, Berry and Tamla (both named after aspects of the
    Motown corporation). Robinson informed his bandmates Pete
    Moore, Bobby Rogers, and best friend Ronald White that he would
    be retiring from the act to concentrate on his duties as
    vice-president of Motown Records.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, Motown's British offices were clamoring for
    a new hit single from the Miracles, who were very popular in
    the United Kingdom. With no new material available from the
    group, which was now planning to break up, Motown Britain
    searched through their back catalog and happened upon "The
    Tears of a Clown". A new mix of the song was made in February
    1970 for the single release, and "The Tears of a Clown" became
    a number-one hit in the UK after its September release.</p>
      <p>This newfound popularity prompted Motown to release the song
    as a single in the United States, where it became a number-one
    hit on both the pop and R&amp;B charts within two months of its
    release. Despite the fact that The Miracles had been one of
    Motown's premier acts in the early and mid-1960s and its first
    successful group act, "The Tears of a Clown" was their first
    and only #1 hit while Smokey Robinson was lead singer. (The
    Miracles hit number one again several years later with the
    smash hit "Love Machine", but by that time Smokey had long
    since left the group, replaced by Billy Griffin. Shop Around
    had hit #1 pop on the Cash Box Pop Chart, but only # 2 on
    Billboard's).</p>
      <p>The 45 single was issued with two different b-sides. The
    first pressing had an alternate version of the 1967 Miracles
    Top 20 hit single "The Love I Saw in You Was Just a Mirage"
    included on the flip side of "The Tears of a Clown", while the
    second included a new Miracles song, "Promise Me". Motown
    released a 
    <i>Tears of a Clown</i>LP in 1970 as well, which was
    essentially a re-packaging of the Miracles' 1967 
    <i>Make It Happen</i>LP.</p>
      <p>Two years later, Smokey Robinson decided to follow through
    with his plans to leave the Miracles and retire. Smokey
    Robinson &amp; the Miracles embarked on a six-month farewell
    tour, which culminated in a July 16, 1972 performance in
    Washington, DC, where Robinson introduced the Miracles' new
    lead singer, Billy Griffin. Interestingly,
    <i>The Tears of a Clown</i>charted 
    <i>again</i>in England six years later, in 1976, becoming a Top
    40 hit, peaking at # 34 (see Miracles Discography) .</p>
      <p>Today, "The Tears of a Clown" continues to be a popular
    radio request.</p>
      <p>A ska-flavored cover of the song was a hit for the English
    ska/ New Wave band The (English) Beat in 1979.</p>
      <p>In 1984, the Flying Pickets covered the song on their album 
    <i>Lost Boys</i>.</p>
      <p>The song was covered on Enuff Z'Nuffs compilation of their
    original demo's 1985 In 1987 a cover was done by "Bassix".</p>
      <p>In late 1993, Australian punk-rock band Caligula had an
    Australian #25 hit with the song.</p>
      <p>The song was covered by La Toya Jackson in 1994 for her
    album 
    <i>Stop! In the Name of Love!</i>, and by Eve in 2007, for
    their album 
    <i>7</i>.</p>
      <p>Phil Collins covered this song on his album 
    <i>Testify</i>.</p>
      <p>The Eminem song 'Beautiful' references this when he says
    "You should be a comedian god damn! unfortunately I am. I just
    hide behind the tears of a clown."</p>
      <p>Brian Ray, guitarist for Paul McCartney, released a
    rock-flavored version of the song in 2005.</p>
