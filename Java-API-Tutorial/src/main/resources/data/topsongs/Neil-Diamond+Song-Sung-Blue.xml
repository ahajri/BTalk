      <p>"Song Sung Blue" is a 1972 song written and recorded by Neil
    Diamond. The song was released off his album, 
    <i>Moods</i>and later appeared on many of Diamond's live and
    compilation albums.</p>
      <p>It was his second #1 hit on the Hot 100 chart in the United
    States, after 1970's "Cracklin' Rosie". The song spent twelve
    weeks in the Top 40. In addition, "Song Sung Blue" spent seven
    weeks at #1 on the adult contemporary chart. In addition, the
    song made the pop chart in the United Kingdom, reaching #14 on
    the UK Singles Chart. The song has become one of Diamond's
    standards, and he often performs this song during concerts.</p>
      <p>"Song Sung Blue" was nominated for two Grammy Awards in
    1973, Record of the Year and Song of the Year. Both awards that
    year were won by Roberta Flack's rendition of Ewan McColl's
    song, "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face".</p>
      <p>Diamond described "Song Sung Blue" in the liner notes to his
    1996 compilation album, 
    <i>In My Lifetime</i>, as a "very basic message, unadorned. I
    didn't even write a bridge to it. I never expected anyone to
    react to "Song Sung Blue" the way they did. I just like it, the
    message and the way a few words said so many things."</p>
