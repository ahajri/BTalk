      <p>"Blame It on the Rain" is a song recorded by Milli Vanilli
    and written by hitmaker Diane Warren. It was their last
    Billboard Hot 100 number one hit (25 November &amp; December 2,
    1989) before their scandal broke out. The club mix version of
    the song was included on the "All or Nothing (U.S. Remix
    Album)" and included scratches and samples from other "rain"
    themed songs such as "Walking in the Rain" and "Raindrops Keep
    Falling On My Head". The extended version of the club mix
    featured the rap from "It's Your Thing", which was an album
    track. The single version of "Blame It On The Rain" did not
    appear on any Milli Vanilli albums until the 2006 "Greatest
    Hits" release.</p>
      <p>This was one of the two songs performed by Milli Vanilli
    themselves when they were a special guest on 
    <i>The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3</i>(The other was
    "Girl You Know It's True"). The plot involved Bowser's attempt
    to kidnap the duo. However, after the scandal broke, the two
    songs were replaced with generic instrumentals in the
    episode.</p>
      <p>The song was re recorded by Sam Moore &amp; Fantasia in
    August 2006 for Moore's star studded compilation album entitled
    
    <i>Overnight Sensational</i>. The remake was produced by Randy
    Jackson and released on Rhino Records.</p>
      <p>In an episode of Full House, D.J. Tanner and Kimmy Gibbler
    are doing homework, and they sing this song. Michelle Tanner
    then sings "Rain, rain, go away...".</p>
      <p>In their song "Blame it on Me," the Barenaked Ladies sing,
    "Milli Vanilli told you to blame it on the rain, but if you
    blame it on the rain tell me what can we gain, if all else
    fails, you can blame it on me."</p>
      <p>On May 15, 2008, contestant Diana Drake sang "Blame It on
    the Rain" on 
    <i>Don't Forget the Lyrics!</i>for the $1,000,000 prize. She
    missed, and dropped down to $100,000.</p>
      <p>On June 20, 2008, The Fenway Park video board and NESN
    debuted a spoof of the song lip synced by Manny Delcarmen and
    Jonathan Papelbon of the Boston Red Sox during a rain delay
    that preceded Boston's game against the St. Louis
    Cardinals.</p>
