      <p>"Poker Face" is a song by American recording artist Lady
    Gaga from her debut album, 
    <i>The Fame</i>. Produced by RedOne, it was released as the
    album's second single in late 2008 for some markets and in
    early 2009 for the rest of the world. The song is an uptempo
    dance song following in the footsteps of her previous single
    "Just Dance" but has a darker musical tone. The main idea
    behind the song is bisexuality and was a tribute by Gaga to her
    rock 'n' roll boyfriends. Lyrically "Poker Face" is about sex
    and gambling.</p>
      <p>"Poker Face" has been well-received by the critics most of
    whom have praised the robotic hook and the chorus. The song has
    attained worldwide success, topping the charts in more than
    seventeen countries including the United States, United
    Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and many European
    countries. "Poker Face" is also the most downloaded song in the
    British chart history. The accompanying music video for the
    song portrays Gaga singing it in various costumes and playing
    strip poker in a mansion.</p>
      <p>Gaga performed the song for the eighth season of the
    television show 
    <i>American Idol</i>as well as the Fame Ball and Monster Ball
    tours. The live performances included an electronic version and
    an acoustic version, which she played on the piano. It was
    nominated in a number of categories at the 52nd Grammy Awards
    and won the award for Best Dance Recording. 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>ranked it number ninety-six on their list
    of 100 Best Songs of the 2000s decade.</p>
      <p>"Poker Face" was written by RedOne and Gaga while the music
    has been produced by RedOne. Gaga stated in an interview that
    "Poker Face" was written by her as a pop song and was a tribute
    to her rock 'n' roll boyfriends. She also stated that the main
    idea behind the song was sex and gambling. In an interview with
    UK's 
    <i>Daily Star</i>, Gaga noted of the song, "It's about a lot of
    different things. I gamble but I’ve also dated a lot of guys
    who are really into sex and booze and gambling, so I wanted to
    write a record my boyfriends would like too." In an interview
    with 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>magazine, when asked about the meaning of
    the line "bluffin' with my muffin", Gaga explained that it
    really was a metaphor for her vulva. She explained,</p>
      <p>"Obviously, it's my pussy's poker face! I took that line
    from another song I wrote but never released, called 'Blueberry
    Kisses.' It was about a girl singing to her boyfriend about how
    she wants him to go down on her, and I used the lyric. [Gaga
    sings] 'Blueberry kisses, the muffin man misses them
    kisses'."</p>
      <p>During her Fame Ball Tour performance at Palm Springs,
    California, on April 11, 2009, Gaga explained to the crowd the
    true meaning behind the term "Poker Face" used in the song. She
    suggested that the song dealt with her personal experience with
    bisexuality. The idea behind the song was to be with a man but
    fantasizing about a woman, hence the man in the song needs to
    read her "Poker Face" to understand what is going through her
    mind.</p>
      <p>"Poker Face" is an uptempo dance-pop song, and follows the
    footsteps of the previous single "Just Dance". Whereas "Just
    Dance" was predominately electropop, "Poker Face" carries a
    dark sound with clear vocals on the chorus and a pop hook while
    combining the synths from "Just Dance" and the more
    dance-oriented beat of the next single "LoveGame". According to
    Kerri Mason of 
    <i>Billboard</i>, the composition "carr[ies] the
    pleather-and-sequins vibe of the downtown New York scene out of
    the underground and onto the FM dial without losing its smut
    and sass." According to the sheet music published in
    Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is set in
    the time signature of common time, with a moderate tempo of 120
    beats per minute. It is written in the key of G-sharp minor
    with Gaga's vocal range spanning from the high-note of F
    <span class="music-symbol"
               style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;">
♯
</span>
         <sub>3</sub>to the low-note of B
    <sub>4</sub>. It begins with a medium tempo followed by
    electronic chord arrangement and the "Mum-mum-mum-mah" hook.
    The chords follow in this order: G
    <span class="music-symbol"
               style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;">
♯
</span>m–G
    <span class="music-symbol"
               style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;">
♯
</span>m–E–F
    <span class="music-symbol"
               style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;">
♯
</span>, and then for the chorus G
    <span class="music-symbol"
               style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;">
♯
</span>m–E–B–F
    <span class="music-symbol"
               style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;">
♯
</span>. This is followed by the sound of dance music, produced by
a powerful beat from the instruments and a stuttering hook
following the chorus.</p>
      <p>Lyrically, "Poker Face" is all about sexual innuendo and
    teasing. According to 
    <i>Daily Star</i>, the chorus repeats two alternating lyrics.
    After the hook "Can't read my Poker Face" the backup singer
    says "He's got me like nobody" and then in the next line says
    "She's got me like nobody". Gaga explained in an interview with
    them that the line carries a bit of an undertone of confusion
    about love and sex. However, the liner notes from the album
    booklet indicate both these lines only repeat "she's got me
    like nobody". According to BBC, the "Mum-mum-mum-mah" hook used
    in the song is sampled from Boney M's 1977 hit "Ma Baker."</p>
      <p>Priya Elan from 
    <i>The Times,</i>in a review for 
    <i>The Fame,</i>said that "Poker Face" was one of the finest
    moments of the album with its "love-as-card-game cheek." 
    <i>BBC</i>reviewed the "strut-tastic" single as "expressing her
    overwhelming desire for celebrity and fortune." Bill Lamb of
    About.com said, "'Poker Face' works well on pop radio, but with
    slight mixing alterations it would be equally at home in a
    dark, sweaty, late night party atmosphere. She has refreshed
    the pop world in the US and UK at one of the slowest times of
    the year. 'Poker Face' keeps the motors humming as everyone
    waits for the next step forward from Lady Gaga." Chris Williams
    of 
    <i>Billboard</i>also gave a positive review of the song saying,
    "Once again, hooks are aplenty, with '80s-inspired
    synthesizers, robotic verses and a warm, sunny hook in the
    chorus, which is even more addictive than the previous single
    ('Just Dance')...With a focused artistic vision, a swagger in
    her interview style and above all, a fantastic collection of
    diverse pop nuggets, Gaga is playing her cards right—and
    "Poker" is another obvious ace."</p>
      <p>
         <i>Slant Magazine</i>music reviewer Sal Cinquemani included
    "Poker Face" among the songs that work in 
    <i>The Fame</i>, namely tracks like "Starstruck," "Paper
    Gangsta" and "Summerboy". Matthew Chisling from Allmusic called
    the song "infectious" and along with the title track "The
    Fame", complimented them for "rejuvenating the vibe on the
    album for its second half." Andy Downing from 
    <i>The Chicago Tribune</i>called the song "jaunty" while
    reviewing Gaga's Fame Ball tour. Evan Sawdey from
    PopMatters.com felt that "Poker Face" along with the track
    "Paparazzi", duplicate much of the same "glitzy territory that
    previous single 'Just Dance' had covered, but never once does
    it feel like Gaga is deliberately repeating herself." 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>in a review for The Fame Ball Tour compared
    the live acoustic "bluesy" version of "Poker Face" with the
    music of singer Amy Winehouse. Erika Hobert from the 
    <i>New Times Broward-Palm Beach</i>newspaper called the song
    "trashtastic Europop." The song was nominated for Grammy Awards
    in the categories for Song of The Year, Record of The Year, and
    Best Dance Recording, ultimately winning the last of these.</p>
      <p>In the United States, the song entered the Hot 100 at

    and "What a Girl Wants" in 1999-2000. The song also peaked on
    both the Hot Dance Airplay and Hot Dance Club Play charts.
    "Poker Face" became the first single since Madonna's 2006
    single "Sorry", to top all the three dance charts in a single
    week including the Hot Dance Singles Sales chart.</p>

      <p>The music video for "Poker Face", directed by Ray Kay and
    aided by Anthony Mandler, was filmed at the luxury villa on
    bwin PokerIsland. bwin also provided the poker equipment and
    obtained product placements in return. The video premiered on
    October 22, 2008. It is set by a pool, as well as in a mansion.
    It begins with Gaga emerging out of the pool wearing a shiny
    masquerade mask and a black full-body leotard, with two Great
    Danes beside her (Lava and her son Rumpus). She throws the mask
    aside and the song begins with a facial shot of Gaga singing
    it. Gaga wears a metallic sticker on her left cheek in this
    shot. Featured in the video are scenes of Gaga in a mansion and
    dancing poolside with her dancers in a turquoise leotard. Gaga
    attends a wild party where every man and woman tries their luck
    on a strip poker game. The party gets wilder when all the
    party's guests strip down to their underwear, dance around, and
    share kisses with each other. The video also features two
    harlequin Great Danes and several white mannequins on her
    swimming pool deck. During the musical interlude before the "I
    won't tell you that I love you" hook, Gaga is shown in her
    trademark "Pop Music Will Never Be Low Brow" sunglasses while
    sitting beside the pool. The video ends with the head shot of
    Gaga singing the Mum-mum-mum-ma hook.</p>
      <p>Gaga explained in the nineteenth episode of her "Transmision
    Gagavision" series, the main idea behind the music video of
    "Poker Face". She said that "I knew I wanted it to be sexy, so
    I thought no pants, because that's sexy, [...]And I knew I
    wanted it to be futuristic, so I thought shoulder pads, because
    that's my thing." The music video premiered on MTV UK on
    February 17, 2009. In some versions of the song, the words
    "muffin" (being a slang term for the woman's vagina), "Russian
    Roulette" and "gun" are censored out (bleeped). On June 21,
    2009, the video won the Best International Artist Video at the
    2009 MuchMusic Video Awards. The video has received four
    nominations at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, in the
    categories of Video of the Year, Best New Artist, Best Female
    Video and Best Pop Video. Along with five other nominations for
    "Paparazzi", Gaga is tied with Beyoncé for most nominations
    each for that year.</p>
      <p>"Poker Face" has been performed by Gaga at a number of shows
    including the AOL Sessions, the 
    <i>Cherrytree House</i>of Interscope Records, and also the 
    <i>MTV</i>sessions. The song was performed by Gaga both in the
    original version and the acoustic piano version in her
    headlining The Fame Ball tour. She performed the piano version
    wearing a dress made of plastic transparent bubbles and playing
    the glass piano with her stilletoes with a glowing mannequin,
    like the music video, standing in front of the stage. Gaga
    claimed that the transparent bubble filled piano was
    specifically made to match her dress. The actual version was
    performed by Gaga as the final song of the encore, after "Boys,
    Boys, Boys". She started the performance saying "Some say Lady
    Gaga is a lie, and they’re right: I am a lie, and every day I
    kill to make it true." Gaga wore a nude corseted leotard
    embellished with crystals and an admiral's hat during the
    performance. The hat as well as the fingerless gloves worn were
    decorated with the word Gaga on it.</p>
      <p>On April 1, 2009, both the acoustic and normal version of
    "Poker Face" was performed live on Fox's 
    <i>American Idol</i>. The performance started with Gaga sitting
    at a Plexiglass piano filled with bubbles and bathed in pink
    light. She started singing the second verse of "Poker Face" in
    a Bette Midler style accompanied by a violin player while
    wearing a shiny aluminum shoulder pad and platinum bleached
    blond wig. After the first chorus, the pace increased whence
    the original intro for the song started. Gaga got up from her
    seat and proceeded to perform the song in the middle of the
    stage. She wore a silvery leotard with a giant star on her
    shoulder and tassels. As the song progressed to the
    intermediate verse, the violist played a hoe-down version of
    the music and Gaga danced around frantically over the stage.
    The performance ended with Gaga staring towards the audience
    while revealing an open zipper, patched over her left eye. The
    performance was described an "alien-disco performance art."
    Cortney Harding of 
    <i>Billboard</i>wrote, "[it was] Gaga's crowning TV moment ...
    show[ing] middle America that she was a bona fide pop
    star."</p>
      <p>The acoustic version was performed by Gaga at BBC Live &amp;
    In-Session on April 19, 2009. She also performed "Poker Face"
    in the United Kingdom on the Paul O'Grady Show. First she
    played an acoustic version first before going on to the normal
    version, and a rock version on 
    <i>Friday Night with Jonathan Ross</i>. On May 12, 2009, Gaga
    performed "Poker Face" on 
    <i>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</i>while wearing a gyroscope on her
    head, designed by theatrical hat designer Nasir Mazhar and
    playing the piano while standing on the stool. Gaga referred to
    the gyroscope as her "Gaga barrier". It prevented Ellen
    DeGeneres from greeting her because of the size of the gear. A
    remixed version of "Poker Face" and "LoveGame" was performed at
    the 2009 MuchMusic Video Awards, during the indoor-outdoor
    streetside show. This performance, which included Gaga beging
    trapped in a fake subway car surrounded by fake police
    officers, was billed as a tribute to New York City. Snippet of
    the song was performed by Gaga at the thirty-fifth season of
    American comedy show 
    <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, while wearing a giant contraption
    ("The Orbit") of several metallic concentric rings that rotated
    around her. It was also performed on Gaga's The Monster Ball
    Tour. The piano version was played by Gaga while balancing on
    the piano stool and holding one leg up in the air. Rapper Kid
    Cudi joined her then to perform his song "Make Her Say" which
    contains a sample of "Poker Face". The actual version was
    performed at the last segment of the show. Gaga wore a dress
    made of guns and during the performance she pumped her hands in
    the air.</p>
      <p>Rapper Kid Cudi's single "Make Her Say" contains a vocal
    sample of the acoustic version of "Poker Face" from 
    <i>The Cherrytree Sessions</i>EP. The song was originally
    entitled "I Poke Her Face" but was changed to make it more
    acceptable for radio. It features Kanye West, who also produced
    the track, and Common, as well as scratches from DJ A-Trak.
    West expressed that he was a fan of Lady Gaga and was
    interested in the song, after seeing Gaga perform a different
    version of "Poker Face" on the internet. This led him to sample
    "Poker Face" in "Make Her Say". According to West, they changed
    the intermittent bisexual theme of the song while taking the
    sample.</p>
      <p>"When I saw that YouTube [video], that's what made me fall
    in love with the song — when I saw her play the acoustic
    version. I could hear all the melody lines. On the 'Poker Face'
    single, she sings it straightforward, almost, like, ripping it
    or chanting it. But this [acoustic version], you hear the
    Broadway melodies run up and down. I was inspired by that. I
    wanted to sample it. I thought it was really dope — just
    on some hip-hop, 'Say when I p-p-poke her face.'"</p>
      <p>Gaga herself voiced approval of the track, saying that West
    "had so much insight into what the song was about."</p>
      <p>Rock musician, Chris Daughtry performed an acoustic version
    of the song while at a radio station in Germany. The song was
    also featured in the South Park episode titled "Whale Whores",
    sung by series character Eric Cartman. Actor Christopher Walken
    performed a special a capella rendition of "Poker Face" on
    BBC1's 
    <i>Friday Night with Jonathan Ross</i>for Halloween 2009. The
    song was also covered by British singer Mika during his visit
    to the BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge. The song was once again covered
    by the American post-hardcore band, Of Mice &amp; Men; it has
    not yet been featured on a release but is featured as streaming
    media online and has received much traffic since its
    upload.</p>
