      <p>"Only Forever" is a song popularized in 1940 by Bing Crosby.
    It reached number 1 on the Billboard charts on October 19,
    1940. "Only Forever" was written by James V. Monaco and Johnny
    Burke for the 1940 film Rhythm on the River.[1] Also recorded
    by Nat King Cole.</p>
      <p>"Only Forever's" lyrics detail how long the singer's love
    will last.</p>
      <p>Do I want to be with you, As the years come and go?, Only
    forever, If you care to know., Would I grant all your wishes,
    And be proud of the task, Only forever, If someone should ask.,
    How long would it take me, To be near if you beckon?, Off hand
    I would figure, Less than a second., Do you think I'll
    remember, How you looked when you smile?, Only forever, That's
    puttin' it mild.,</p>
      <p>How long would it take me, To be near if you beckon?, Off
    hand I would figure, Less than a second., Do you think I'll
    remember, How you looked when you smile?, Only forever, That's
    puttin' it mild.,</p>
