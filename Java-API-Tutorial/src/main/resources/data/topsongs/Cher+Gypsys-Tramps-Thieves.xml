      <p>"Gypsys, Tramps &amp; Thieves" is the first single released
    by Cher for the album of the same name, her seventh solo album.
    It was her first chart-topper as a solo artist in the United
    States.</p>
      <p>"Gypsies, Tramps &amp; Thieves" was the first single from
    Cher's 1971 self-titled album 
    <i>Cher</i>. The album was subsequently renamed and re-released
    as 
    <i>Gypsys, Tramps &amp; Thieves</i>after the success of the
    single. The song was written by songwriter Bob Stone as a
    story-song called "Gypsies Tramps and White Trash". Producer
    Snuff Garrett advised that the title be changed and Stone then
    changed it to "Gypsies Tramps and Thieves".</p>
      <p>It hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 on November 6, 1971, and
    it remained there for two consecutive weeks. The single also
    reached #1 in Canada and the Top 10 in many European countries,
    becoming the number-one selling single of 1971 at more than 3
    million copies worldwide. Today it remains one of her signature
    songs.</p>
      <p>The song describes the life of a girl, the narrator of the
    song, who was "born in the wagon of a traveling show". Her
    mother "used to dance for the money they'd throw", while her
    father would do "whatever he could; preach a little gospel,
    sell a couple bottles of doctor good". Although the people of
    the town called them "gypsies, tramps and thieves", every night
    "all the men would come around, and lay their money down".</p>
      <p>When a young man is picked up, just south of Mobile, the
    narrator is 16, while he is 21. Her family took care of him for
    a while, although her father "would have shot him if he knew
    what he'd done". Three months later, the narrator describes
    herself as a "girl in trouble", and her young man has
    disappeared.</p>
      <p>Echoing the beginning of the song, her own daughter was
    "born in the wagon of a traveling show", while her mother, the
    narrator herself, dances "for the money they'd throw".</p>
      <p>The title of this song has also been shown with alternate
    spellings of "Gypsies" / "Gypsys". The lyrics of the song are
    often ridiculed for their claim to have "picked up a boy just
    south of Mobile", the idea being that "just south of Mobile" is
    somewhere in the Gulf of Mexico. In fact, there are at least
    six small communities directly south of Mobile on the west side
    of the bay, and twice that many on the east side.</p>
      <p>Cher performed the song on the following concert tours:</p>
      <p>The video for "Gypsies, Tramps &amp; Thieves" was Cher's
    first music video. The video was a recorded performance of the
    song on 
    <i>The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour</i>in 1971. Throughout the
    video Cher is singing in front of a house wagon and in front of
    a fire. A second video was made, but it was very similar to the
    original. In the second video, clips of dancing female gypsies
    were shown.</p>
      <p>In 2002, a special remix medley was created by Dan-O-Rama
    for a video montage that was used in Cher's Living Proof: The
    Farewell Tour. The medley contains the videos of "All I Really
    Want to Do", "Gypsies, Tramps &amp; Thieves", "Half-Breed", and
    "Dark Lady".</p>
