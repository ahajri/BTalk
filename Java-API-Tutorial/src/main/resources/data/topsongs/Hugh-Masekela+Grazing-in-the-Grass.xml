      <p>"Grazing in the Grass" is an instrumental composed by
    Philemon Hou and first recorded by the South African trumpeter
    Hugh Masekela. It is recognizable by its prominent cowbell
    part. Released in the United States as a single in 1968, it
    became one of the few instrumentals to reach the #1 spot on the
    Billboard Hot 100 chart. .</p>
      <p>"Grazing in the Grass" was inspired by an earlier Masekela
    recording, "Mr. Bull No. 5". Hou, an actor and singer, came up
    with the melody while the backing track was already being
    recorded. The session was held at Gold Star Studios in
    Hollywood.</p>
      <p>The Friends of Distinction recorded a vocal cover version of
    the tune in 1969 which was also a Top Ten pop and R&amp;B hit,
    reaching #3 on the former and #5 on the latter. . The group's
    Harry Elston penned lyrics for the song and sang lead on
    it."Grazing in the Grass" has been recorded by many other
    musicians, including Chet Atkins, Boney James, Rick Braun,
    Willie Mitchell, The Monitors, Meco, and cc: DIVA. In 2004 it
    was covered by Raven-Symoné; her version was played on Radio
    Disney but never received a general commercial release as a
    single for airplay in other venues. The video for her version
    features her and dancing extras interacting with scenes from 
    <i>The Lion King 1½</i>. It is also a staple in the repertoire
    of New Orleans brass bands.</p>
      <p>"Grazing in the Grass" was sampled by the hip hop duo Nice
    &amp; Smooth on the track "One, Two and One More Makes Three"
    from their album 
    <i>Ain't a Damn Thing Changed</i>. Also, a sample can be heard
    in Sugar Ray's 1999 single "Every Morning".</p>
