      <p>"Our Day Will Come" (1963) is a popular song composed by Bob
    Hilliard and Mort Garson and was first recorded by Ruby &amp;
    The Romantics later that year. The Ruby &amp; the Romantics
    version was notable for the use of the Hammond organ and hit
    the #1 position on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and spent two
    weeks in the top spot of the U.S. Billboard R&amp;B/Soul
    Singles chart.</p>
      <p>The American West Coast group We Five recorded the song for
    their second album (1967).</p>
      <p>One lineup of the Peter Ivers Band, featuring India-born
    jazz diva Asha Puthli, recorded the song for the band's second
    album 
    <i>Take It Out On Me</i>. This album was initially shelved by
    Sony in 1970 but finally released in 2009 on Wounded Bird
    Records.</p>
      <p>In 1975, Frankie Valli followed up his #6 hit "Swearin' to
    God" with his version of "Our Day Will Come" to capitalize on
    the rising popularity of disco. His cover reached the #11
    position on the singles charts. His solo career now solidly
    established (all Frankie Valli singles from the 1960s and his
    1974 hit "My Eyes Adored You" were recorded with the Four
    Seasons), the three Valli hits of 1975 set the stage for the
    chart and sales comeback for his group, The Four Seasons.</p>
      <p>"Our Day Will Come" was covered by contemporary ska band The
    Slackers on their 1996 debut LP 
    <i>Better Late Than Never</i>featuring Doreen Shaffer on
    vocals.</p>
