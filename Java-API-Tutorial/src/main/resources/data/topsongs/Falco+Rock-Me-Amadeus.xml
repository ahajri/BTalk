      <p>"Rock Me Amadeus" is a 1986 song by the Austrian pop
    musician Falco from his album 
    <i>Falco 3</i>. It topped the singles charts on both sides of
    the Atlantic. It was Falco's only major hit in the United
    States and one of only two singles to make the Top Ten in the
    United Kingdom, despite his popularity in Germany, his native
    Austria, and much of Europe. The song was written by Dutch
    music producers Bolland &amp; Bolland.</p>
      <p>With "Rock Me Amadeus", Falco became the first
    German-speaking artist to be credited with a #1 single in all
    mainstream U.S. pop singles charts: the Billboard Hot 100 and
    Cashbox Top 100 Singles. The single hit number one on the
    Billboard Hot 100 on 29 March 1986. Falco is erroneously often
    considered a one-hit wonder for this song in the United States.
    However, Falco had already had a minor U.S. hit in 1982 with
    "Der Kommissar" (a hit the following year there for After the
    Fire), and his follow-up single from 
    <i>Falco 3</i>, "Vienna Calling", reached #18 on the Hot
    100.</p>
      <p>In the United Kingdom, the song hit number one on 10 May
    1986, becoming the first single by an Austrian act to achieve
    this distinction. In the UK, where his "Der Kommissar" failed
    to make the charts, Falco is also often regarded as a one-hit
    wonder, despite the fact that "Vienna Calling" hit number ten
    and three subsequent singles briefly charted.</p>
      <p>In Canada, the song reached #2 in March 1986. (There, "Der
    Kommissar" had reached #11 in January 1983, and "Vienna
    Calling" would hit #8 in April 1986.)</p>
      <p>"Rock Me Amadeus" would later be ranked #87 in VH1's 100
    Greatest Songs of the 80s and #44 in VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit
    Wonders.</p>
      <p>The song, recorded in German and about Wolfgang Amadeus
    Mozart, talks about his popularity and his debts. A longer
    version (eight minutes), named the "Salieri Mix", appeared on
    the initial U.S. release of the album 
    <i>Falco 3</i>. The song was inspired by the movie 
    <i>Amadeus</i>. For the U.S. release, the song was remixed with
    an English background overlay by L.A. DJ Chris Modig. There was
    never a full English version.</p>
      <p>The song's music video mixed elements of Mozart's time with
    modern times; early on, Falco is shown in a modern dinner
    jacket walking past people in eighteenth-century formal wear.
    Later, he is shown dressed as Mozart, with wild colored hair,
    being held on the shoulders of men dressed in modern
    motorcycle-riding gear. At the end, the two crowds mix
    together.</p>
      <p>The song has been lampooned and paid tribute to by many:</p>
