      <p>"At This Moment" is a song that was first recorded by Billy
    Vera &amp; The Beaters in 1981 during a string of performances
    at the Roxy in West Hollywood (January 15-17) and featured on
    their self-titled live album, 
    <i>Billy and the Beaters</i>, released that same year.</p>
      <p>When it was originally released as a single, the song
    stalled on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at #79. However, the
    song was included on an episode of the NBC sitcom 
    <i>Family Ties</i>during the 1985-86 season, where it was the
    love song associated with Alex P. Keaton (played by Michael J.
    Fox) and his girlfriend Ellen Reed (played by Tracy Pollan,
    whom Fox eventually married in real-life) on the show, and this
    renewed interest in the song. "At This Moment" began a revived
    chart run, eventually peaking at #1 on both the Hot 100 and
    adult contemporary charts in late January 1987. The song also
    crossed over to the country format, peaking at #42 on the
    country singles chart.</p>
      <p>A cover version was recorded by country music singer Neal
    McCoy on his 1990 debut album, also titled 
    <i>At This Moment</i>. McCoy's version was released as a
    single, although it did not chart. Another cover version of the
    song appears on Michael Bubl√©'s 2009 album, 
    <i>Crazy Love</i>.</p>
