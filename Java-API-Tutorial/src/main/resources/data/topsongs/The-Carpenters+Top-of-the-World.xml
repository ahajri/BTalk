      <p>"Top of the World" is the name of a 1973 song by The
    Carpenters. The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 in 1973,
    becoming the duo's second U.S. number-one single. Originally
    intended to be only an album cut for the Carpenters, Lynn
    Anderson covered the song; Anderson's version reached #2 on the
    U.S. country singles charts in mid-1973. The success of
    Anderson's version prompted the Carpenters to release a new
    version as a single, where it topped the U.S. pop singles
    chart. Karen Carpenter re-recorded the song for the band's
    first compilation as she was not quite satisfied with the
    original. Brother Richard Carpenter has remixed the song's
    vocals, most recently for their 35th Anniversary 
    <i>Gold</i>compilation.</p>
      <p>Swedish dansband Vikingarna had a 1974 Svensktoppen hit with
    a cover version in Swedish, "På världens tak", which was the
    first Vikingarna song at Svensktoppen .</p>
      <p>In 1992, Björk covered the song still on The Sugarcubes and
    it was included on their album titled Walkabout.</p>
      <p>Shonen Knife's cover appeared on the 1994 tribute album 
    <i>If I Were a Carpenter</i>. It was the ending theme song to
    the 1995 film 
    <i>The Last Supper</i>and appeared in the 1998 film 
    <i>The Parent Trap</i>.</p>
      <p>Mark O'Connor did an acoustic guitar and mandolin (David
    Grisman) version of the song on his 1979 album Markology.</p>
      <p>In 2006, a Bossa-Nova version of the song was included in
    Naomi's &amp; Goro album titled 
    <i>[HOME]</i>.</p>
      <p>A Cantonese Christian song by the name of 冰天的太陽 was written
    using the melody of the song.</p>
      <p>this song bears resemblance to the 1963 hit 'Drownin' my
    sorrows' (Connie Francis)</p>
