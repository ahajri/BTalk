      <p>"Georgia on My Mind" is a song written in 1930 by Hoagy
    Carmichael (music) and Stuart Gorrell (lyrics). It is the
    official state song of the U.S. state of Georgia. Gorrell wrote
    the lyrics for Hoagy's sister, Georgia Carmichael . However,
    the lyrics of the song are ambiguous enough to refer either to
    the state or to a woman named "Georgia". Carmichael's 1965
    autobiography, 
    <i>Sometimes I Wonder</i>, records the origin: a friend,
    saxophonist and bandleader Frankie Trumbauer, suggested: "Why
    don't you write a song called 'Georgia?' Nobody lost much
    writing about the South." Thus, the song is universally
    believed to have been written about the state.</p>
      <p>The song was first recorded on September 15, 1930 in New
    York by Hoagy Carmichael and His Orchestra with Bix Beiderbecke
    on muted cornet and Hoagy Carmichael on vocals. The recording
    was part of Bix Beiderbecke's last recording session. The
    recording was released as Victor 23013 with "One Night in
    Havana".</p>
      <p>Frankie Trumbauer had the first major hit recording in 1931
    when his recording made the top ten on the charts. Trumbauer
    had suggested that Carmichael compose the song.</p>
      <p>The song is perhaps best known as sung by Ray Charles, who
    recorded it in 1960 on the album 
    <i>The Genius Hits the Road</i>. It became Georgia's state song
    in 1979. Inspired by this blues version, Willie Nelson formally
    introduced the song to country audiences in 1978 as a #1
    Country/Western hit.</p>
      <p>The song was first recorded by Hoagy Carmichael (with Bix
    Beiderbecke) in 1930. The song has subsequently been covered by
    many artists, significant among them: Frankie Trumbauer and His
    Orchestra, Louis Armstrong, Dean Martin, Glenn Miller, Michael
    Bublé, Ian Moss, Willie Nelson, Michael Bolton, Anita O'Day,
    Ella Fitzgerald, Jo Stafford, Red McKenzie and His Mound City
    Blue Blowers in 1931, Gladys Knight, Gene Krupa, James Brown,
    Alicia Keys and Jamie Foxx, Usher, Fats Waller, Billie Holiday,
    Nat Gonella and his Georgians, The Band, Django Reinhardt, Wes
    Montgomery, John Mayer, Jerry Lee Lewis, The Righteous
    Brothers, Tom Jones, Van Morrison, Coldplay, The Joel Haynes
    Trio (with Denzel Sinclair) and the Spencer Davis Group (with
    Steve Winwood on vocals), Tony Rice in his California Autumn
    album, as well as Arturo Sandoval in his Ronnie Scott's Jazz
    House album, and an instrumental version by Oscar Peterson.
    Czech singer Pavel Novak recorded song in 1968.</p>
      <p>On 30 July 1963, Lou Rawls recorded the song for his album
    "Tobacco Road". Cold Chisel's version of the song has become a
    staple of their live shows. Guitarist Ian Moss still performs
    the song and a live version is included in his "Let's All Get
    Together" album. American Idol (Season 8) contestant Matt
    Giraud performed this song during Hollywood Week Second Solo
    Performance.</p>
      <p>It was not until Ray Charles' 1960 recording on 
    <i>The Genius Hits the Road</i>that the song became a major
    hit, reaching the number one spot for one week in November 1960
    on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. On March 7, 1979, in a mutual
    symbol of reconciliation after conflict over civil rights
    issues, he performed it before the Georgia General Assembly
    (the state legislature). After this performance, the connection
    to the 
    <i>state</i>was firmly made, and then the Assembly adopted it
    as the state song on April 24.</p>
      <p>This version of the song was played with a video montage
    each time that Georgia Public Television went off the air
    nightly. With the advent of 24-hour broadcasting, it is rarely
    used now, the last time being in 2009 for the permanent
    sign-off of GPB's analog TV stations on February 17.</p>
      <p>The song was used as the theme song to the CBS sitcom 
    <i>Designing Women</i>(set in Atlanta), initially as an
    instrumental (performed by Doc Severinsen), and later in a
    recording by Ray Charles. Charles' version was also sampled for
    rap group Field Mob's 2005 single, "Georgia", featuring Jamie
    Foxx and Ludacris.</p>
      <p>Sometime after 2000, Charles invited the Italian singer
    Giorgia Todrani to sing the song with him after learning that
    she was named in honor of the song.</p>
      <p>Jamie Foxx and Alicia Keys, backed by Quincy Jones &amp; his
    Orchestra, performed a new arrangement in honour of Ray Charles
    at the 2005 Grammy Awards.</p>
      <p>In 2003, 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>magazine named "Georgia on My Mind" the
    44th greatest song of all time.</p>
      <p>The title of the song was used as the state of Georgia's
    license plate slogan exclusively from January 1997 through
    November 2003, with some of these plates remaining valid
    through at least December 2009.</p>
      <p>The song is referenced in The Beatles' "Back in the USSR",
    with the line "Georgia's always on my mind" referring to the
    Georgian SSR (Soviet Georgia).</p>
      <p>The song is featured in the Stone Mountain Laser Show that
    runs each summer outside Atlanta.</p>
      <p>The song was one of the songs of the 1996 Summer Olympics
    held in Atlanta.</p>
      <p>In the television show 
    <i>Quantum Leap</i>, the Ray Charles version of the song is
    used in several episodes, since it was the song which played at
    the wedding of the supporting character Al Calavicci. The usage
    license was limited, and when the series was released on DVD in
    the USA, the producers decided they could not afford to renew
    the rights, so the song was replaced with generic instrumental
    music. Since the song was used in several emotional scenes,
    some fans were disappointed with this decision.</p>
      <p>The song is mentioned in the Johnny Flynn song, "Hong Kong
    Cemetery".</p>
      <p>The song is featured at the end of the House episode
    "Saviors" performed by Hugh Laurie.</p>
      <p>The lyrics to Ray Charles' version of this song appear in
    the Georgia Code under license.</p>
