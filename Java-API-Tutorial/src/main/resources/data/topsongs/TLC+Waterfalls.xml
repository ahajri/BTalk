      <p>"Waterfalls" is a 1995 single by R&amp;B trio TLC from their
    second album 
    <i>CrazySexyCool</i>and the group's signature song. The song
    was produced by Organized Noize and written by Marqueze
    Etheridge, TLC member Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes, and Organized
    Noize. It was the 2nd biggest Hot 100 single of 1995, according
    to Billboard's Year End Chart. TLC performed the song at the
    2008 BET Awards along with Alicia Keys.</p>
      <p>The music video was filmed at Universal Studios Hollywood;
    directed by F. Gary Gray and features Ella Joyce, Bokeem
    Woodbine, Shyheim, Paul J. Alessi and Gabrielle Bramford. The
    song and video tackle the issues of drug dealing and HIV.</p>
      <p>The song hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for seven
    weeks from July 8, 1995 - August 19, 1995. The background
    vocals on the recording were performed by all three members of
    TLC, as well as Debra Killings and Cee-Lo.</p>
      <p>The song shares its title and possibly similar melodies
    &amp; lyrics with "Waterfalls", a 1980 song by Paul McCartney.
    TLC's chorus begins, "Don't go chasing waterfalls / Please
    stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to", while
    McCartney's song begins, "Don't go jumping waterfalls / Please
    keep to the lake"; the second verse begins, "Don't go chasing
    polar bears".</p>
      <p>The song was parodied by "Weird Al" Yankovic as "Phony
    Calls", a reference to prank calls, on the 1996 album 
    <i>Bad Hair Day</i>.</p>
      <p>TLC performed this song on MTV's 20th Anniversary in August
    2001, TLC's final performance before Left Eye's death.</p>
