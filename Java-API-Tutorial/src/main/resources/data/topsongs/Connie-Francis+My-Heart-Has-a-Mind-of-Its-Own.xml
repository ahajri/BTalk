      <p>"My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own" is a song written by Howard
    Greenfield and Jack Keller which was a #1 hit for Connie
    Francis in 1960.</p>
      <p>Francis recorded "My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own" at Radio
    Recorders studio in Hollywood CA over three different sessions
    on July 9, 25, and 31, 1960 with Jesse Kaye and Arnold Maxin
    acting as producers; Gus Levene arranged the orchestration and
    conducted. The musicians included Art Kaplan on saxophone.</p>
      <p>Several takes from these sessions are still extant. The
    original MGM K 12923 single utilized Take 49 (recorded July 31,
    1960) but two weeks into release this was replaced by Take 37
    (recorded July 25, 1960) at the behest of Francis and the
    song's writers.</p>
      <p>"My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own" became Francis' second
    consecutive A-side to top the Hot 100 reaching #1 on the chart
    dated 26 September 1960 and holding there the following week.
    The single also marked Francis' final appearance of the R&amp;B
    charts at #11.</p>
      <p>In the UK "My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own" reached #3.</p>
      <p>On 18 October 1960, Francis recorded a German language
    version of "My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own" entitled "Mein Herz
    weiß genau, was es will" but to limit the release of Francis'
    single in Germany to its English version which reached #37. A
    German language version distinct from that cut by Francis
    entitled "So, wie es damals war" was recorded by Siw Malmkvist
    (a multi-tracked recording credited to the Jolly Sisters), Nana
    Gualdi, Gina Dobra, and Trixie Kühn, none of whose versions
    reached the German charts.</p>
      <p>Unlike Francis' precedent #1 "Everybody's Somebody's Fool",
    "My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own" did not become a C&amp;W
    crossover hit for Francis herself but the song was subsequently
    recorded by several high profile C&amp;W songstresses beginning
    with Connie Smith on her 1966 album 
    <i>Downtown Country</i>. In 1971 Smith's version was included
    on a compilation release which was entitled 
    <i>My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own</i>.</p>
      <p>"My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own" was recorded by Reba
    McEntire early in her career; that version was first released
    on the 1994 compilation 
    <i>Oklahoma Girl</i>. "My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own" was also
    one of several Pop classic hits covered by Sandy Posey on 
    <i>One Fine Day</i>a 2005 CD release which marked Posey's
    return to her countrypolitan roots on which Francis' "Who's
    Sorry Now?" and "My Happiness" were also remade.</p>
      <p>"My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own" was a C&amp;W hit in 1972
    for Susan Raye (#10) and in 1979 for Debby Boone (#11); Boone
    subsequently made less successful bids for C&amp;W chart
    success with remakes of the Connie Francis hits "Breakin' in a
    Brand New Broken Heart" (#25) and "Everybody's Somebody's Fool"
    (#48).</p>
