      <p>"Breaking Up Is Hard to Do" is a song recorded by Neil
    Sedaka and described by Allmusic as "two minutes and sixteen
    seconds of pure pop magic".[1] It is considered to be Sedaka's
    signature song. It hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 on
    August 11, 1962 and was a good hit all over the world,
    sometimes with the text translated into foreign languages. For
    example, the Italian version was called "Tu non lo sai" (" You
    don't know ") and was recorded by Sedaka himself.</p>
      <p>Originally an uptempo song, Sedaka re-recorded it as a
    ballad in 1975 and the new version peaked at number eight in
    February 1976 and went to number one on the Adult Contemporary
    chart; it was only the second time that an artist made the
    Billboard Top Ten with two different versions of the same
    song.</p>
      <p>"Breaking Up Is Hard to Do" has been covered by numerous
    other artists over the years, including:</p>
