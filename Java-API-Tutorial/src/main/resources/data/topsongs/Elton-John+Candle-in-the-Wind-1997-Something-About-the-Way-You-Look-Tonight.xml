      <p>"Candle in the Wind 1997" is a remake of his own 1973 hit
    "Candle in the Wind" by Sir Elton John that was released as a
    tribute single to Diana, Princess of Wales. With over 37
    million copies sold, it is the best-selling single of all time
    since records began. On release in September 1997, "Candle in
    the Wind 1997" peaked at number one in the UK, becoming John's
    fourth number one single, and in most other countries
    worldwide, also becoming the first song in history to reach the
    top in each of the four major countries in the music industry:
    United States, Japan, United Kingdom, and Germany.</p>
      <p>The lyrics of the earlier version of "Candle in the Wind,"
    written by Bernie Taupin, were a tribute to Marilyn Monroe. The
    opening lines of the 1973 version, "Goodbye Norma Jean, though
    I never knew you at all," were adapted to "Goodbye England's
    rose, may you ever grow in our hearts." In fact, most of the
    lyrics were adapted to suit the circumstances of Diana's life
    and death, but a notable and poignantly ironic omission was the
    line, "Even when you died, the press still hounded you..."</p>
      <p>On 31 August 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales was killed in a
    car crash in Paris, France. The news immediately shocked Elton
    John, as he and the Princess had been very good friends: he had
    also lost another good friend, the fashion designer Gianni
    Versace, earlier in the summer, and had attended his funeral
    with Diana.</p>
      <p>As a result of these deaths, John sank into a deep
    depression, and considered not going to the funeral due to the
    emotional trauma. In the end, he decided to attend after
    receiving support from other friends. Following the recovery,
    John decided he wanted to pay a tribute to Diana: with that in
    mind, he contacted his veteran writing partner, Bernie Taupin.
    Due to the confusion created by a message John left on Taupin's
    answering machine in which he asked Taupin to write a lyric
    similar to "Candle in the Wind", Taupin rewrote that song.
    George Martin was contacted to help produce the song, and added
    a string quartet, (Peter Manning, Keith Pascoe, Levine Andrade
    and Andrew Shulman), and woodwind (Pippa Davies, flute) to help
    balance the recording.</p>
      <p>John publicly performed "Candle in the Wind 1997" only once,
    at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales in Westminster Abbey
    on 6 September 1997. Though he continues to sing the original
    1973 version of the song at his concerts, John has repeatedly
    turned down requests to perform the 1997 version. He refused
    even when asked to do so for the memorial Concert for Diana in
    July 2007, having vowed never to perform it again unless asked
    by Diana's sons. The song has never been released (or
    re-released) on any of his other albums or compilations, not
    even on the 1997 
    <i>Diana Princess of Wales: Tribute</i>album (an official 2-CD
    release sanctioned by Diana's family that included other
    artists such as Celine Dion and Rod Stewart).</p>
      <p>"Candle in the Wind" was expected to debut high on the
    charts, partly due to its tribute to the death of Diana,
    Princess of Wales; but its actual results were record breaking.
    Released on 13 September 1997, it became the fastest-selling
    single in the UK, selling 658,000 copies in its first day of
    release, and over 1.5 million copies in its first week. The
    single would remain at number one for 5 weeks, and it
    eventually sold 4.86 million copies in the UK, overtaking the
    13-year-old record held by Band Aid's "Do They Know It's
    Christmas?". It has been certified as the best-selling single
    of all time in the UK.</p>
      <p>The chart success in the United States was similar. Release
    on 22 September 1997, "Candle in the Wind" debuted at number
    one, with first week sales at a staggering 3.5 million copies.
    As a result, the album/single stayed at the top of the charts
    for 14 consecutive weeks, a record for a male solo artist. The
    single sold over 11 million copies in the United States and
    became the best-selling single worldwide, with estimated
    worldwide sales totaling over 35 million copies.</p>
      <p>The single's success was also seen in most countries around
    the world. In Canada, the single spent three years in the top
    20, with 45 non-consecutive weeks at the top spot. However, the
    song's unusual chart performance in Canada has also been
    explained as a structural factor; due to the relative lack of
    CD singles available for sale in Canadian stores, in some weeks
    the song was able to chart on sales of less than 100 copies
    across the entire country.</p>
      <p>As a testament to the single's success, it is estimated that
    at the peak of sales, almost six copies of the single were sold
    across the world 
    <i>per second</i>. All artist and composer royalties and record
    company profits were donated to the Diana, Princess of Wales
    Memorial Fund.</p>
