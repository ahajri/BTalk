      <p>"Welcome Back" is a well known record that was the theme
    song of the 1970s American television sitcom 
    <i>Welcome Back, Kotter</i>. Written and recorded by former
    Lovin' Spoonful frontman John Sebastian, it reached number-one
    on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for one week in the spring of
    1976 after only five weeks on the chart (the show had become an
    instant ratings success upon its premiere the previous Fall).
    The song also topped the Hot Adult Contemporary Singles Chart
    and #93 on Hot Country Songs.</p>
      <p>TV producer Alan Sachs wanted a Lovin' Spoonful-like theme
    song for a new ABC sitcom entitled 
    <i>Kotter</i>. Sach's agent, Dave Bendet, also represented
    Sebastian and arranged for a meeting between the two. The
    producers liked the song so much that they changed the name of
    the sitcom to 
    <i>Welcome Back, Kotter</i>. Co-produced by Steve Barri and
    Sebastian, the song eventually sold over one million
    copies.</p>
      <p>The song was sampled by rapper Ma$e for his song, also
    titled "Welcome Back". Also by hip hop group Onyx in their song
    "Slam harder".</p>
