      <p>"(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty" is a song recorded
    and released in 1976 by KC and the Sunshine Band for the album 
    <i>Part 3</i>. The song became their third number-one hit on
    the Billboard Hot 100, as well as their third number-one on the
    soul singles chart. The song was originally controversial,
    since the lyrics were interpreted by many as having sexual
    connotations. The b-side of Shake Your Booty was "Boogie
    Shoes", which later became a hit on its own when it appeared on
    the 
    <i>Saturday Night Fever</i>soundtrack in 1978. Richard Finch
    explained to Songfacts that this song was directly inspired by
    dance moves they witnessed in clubs, especially when somebody
    broke loose and started to "shake their booty."</p>
