   <descr>
      <p>"4 Seasons of Loneliness" is a R&amp;B/pop ballad recorded
    by Philadelphia-based vocal quartet Boyz II Men. Written and
    produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, the song was issued as
    the first single from the 
    <i>Evolution</i>album in 1997.</p>
      <p>Already a success at U.S. radio, the release of the single
    prompted a Hot 100 debut at number two. The following week the
    song moved up to number one, becoming Boyz II Men's fifth and
    last chart-topper. The song spent one week at the top before
    being pushed aside by Elton John's massive Princess Diana
    tribute single "Candle in the Wind 1997". It was also the
    group's last top ten hit in the UK, debuting at number ten on
    the singles chart, and dropping off the chart a short time
    after.</p>
      <p>Spanish-version, "4 Estaciones de Soledad"</p>
