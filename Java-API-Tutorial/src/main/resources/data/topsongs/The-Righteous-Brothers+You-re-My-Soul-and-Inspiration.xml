      <p>"(You're My) Soul And Inspiration" was the first and only
    major hit for American popgroup The Righteous Brothers after
    parting ways with their long time producer, Phil Spector, as
    well as the title track to the album. The single peaked at #1
    on the US Billboard Hot 100 and the Canadian CHUM Charts as
    well as reaching #15 on the UK Singles Chart.</p>
      <p>After leaving Spector's Philles Records in late 1965, citing
    personal difficulties with the producer , the duo made the jump
    to the mostly jazz-oriented Verve label and teamed up with
    Songwriters Hall of Famers, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, who
    were then part of the legendary Brill Building pop machine in
    New York City. Mann and Weil had already co-written the group's
    previous #1, "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'" with Spector,
    and were familiar with their style and capabilities. The
    production, by group baritone Bill Medley, with reverbing
    pop-orchestra and soaring female back-up choir, is highly
    imitative of Spector's "Wall of Sound" and doesn't contrast the
    sound of the group's early hits.</p>
      <p>This would, however, mark the end of the group's peak in
    popularity. Although they would chart again with their next
    single, the religiously-oriented "He"(#18 US), before briefly
    splitting in 1968, they would not break the top-10 again until
    reuniting in 1974 with "Rock and Roll Heaven", an ode to fallen
    musical comrades.</p>
      <p>In 1972, reggae artist Paddy Corea covered the tune
    instrumentally for UK-label, Trojan Records'. The song is
    currently available on the 1995 cover-compilation 
    <i>Keep on Running</i>.</p>
      <p>Donnie &amp; Marie Osmond released a version for their 1977
    album 
    <i>A Winning Combination</i>.</p>
      <p>In 1990, country music group The Oak Ridge Boys recorded a
    cover version for the soundtrack to the film 
    <i>My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys</i>. Their version peaked
    at #31 on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks charts.</p>
