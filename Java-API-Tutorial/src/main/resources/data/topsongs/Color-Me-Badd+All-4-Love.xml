   <descr>
      <p>"All 4 Love" (also known as "All for Love") is a number-one
    single by the music group Color Me Badd released in 1991 as the
    third single from their debut album 
    <i>C.M.B.</i>As a number-one single, it replaced Michael
    Jackson's "Black or White" and was then replaced by Elton John
    and George Michael's "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me" in early
    1992. It was the band's second number-one single in the US, and
    also their last one. The recording contains elements and/or
    samples of the 1966 minor R&amp;B hit "Patch My Heart" by The
    Mad Lads. In 2002, Stevie Brock covered it as his first
    single.</p>
