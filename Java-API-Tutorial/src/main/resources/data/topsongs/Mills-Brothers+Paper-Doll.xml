      <p>"Paper Doll" was a hit song for the Mills Brothers. In the
    United States it held the number-one position on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>singles chart for twelve weeks, from November
    6, 1943, to January 22, 1944. The success of the song
    represented something of a revival for the group, after a few
    years of declining sales.</p>
      <p>The song has been named one of the Songs of the Century and
    has been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. It appeared in
    the films 
    <i>The Execution of Private Slovik</i>and 
    <i>The Majestic</i>and in the British television miniseries 
    <i>The Singing Detective</i>. Four lines of it are sung by
    Rodolfo in the first act of Arthur Miller's play 
    <i>A View from the Bridge</i>.</p>
      <p>The song was written in 1915 (although it was not published
    until 1930) by Johnny S. Black, whose greatest success would
    come with his song "Dardanella," which sold 5,000,000 copies in
    a recording by bandleader Ben Selvin in 1920, and a further
    2,000,000 copies of sheet music. Black died in 1936, six years
    before his second greatest success, "Paper Doll," swept the
    country.</p>
