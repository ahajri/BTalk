      <p>"To Be with You" is a song by the American hard rock band
    Mr. Big. It appears on the album 
    <i>Lean into It</i>. The song charted in 20 plus countries,
    many of them at number one, such as on the United States Hot
    100. It also reached a peak of number three in the UK.</p>
      <p>"To Be With You" is about a man who has his eye on a woman
    who has recently experienced a broken heart from a previous
    relationship.</p>
      <p>The song was written and composed by Eric Martin during his
    teen years. Paul contributed to its melodic arrangements later
    on. Writing credit is also given to David Grahame, a songwriter
    working for the label at the time (though exactly what
    contributions each of the three men made to the song is
    unclear).</p>
      <p>In his solo career Mr. Big, guitarist Paul Gilbert performed
    the song live using the riff from the Van Halen song "Ain't
    Talkin' 'Bout Love".</p>
      <p>While in Paul's apartment at Yucca Street in L.A., Eric and
    Paul were laying out their compositions. Eric had this ballad
    called "To Be With You". Paul had his psychedelic rock song
    called "Green Tinted Sixties Mind". Both felt the two songs
    were strong enough to be included in their upcoming album,
    despite it being purely rock; and true enough, these songs
    remained throughout the course of their career as a group and
    as solo artists.</p>
      <p>Irish pop group Westlife performed the song during the
    acoustic session of their 2003 Greatest Hits Tour, and it was
    subsequently included on their 
    <i>Turnaround</i>album later that year.</p>
      <p>Australian male vocal group Human Nature included a cover of
    the song in their 2004 
    <i>Walk the Tightrope</i>studio album. Their interpretation was
    somewhat more pop/R&amp;B than the original.</p>
      <p>Andrew Spencer has also made dance remixes of the song in
    late 2007, early 2008. The pop-punk band Allister has also made
    a cover of the song.</p>
