      <p>"Touch Me in the Morning" is a popular song recorded by
    Diana Ross on the Motown label. It became her second Billboard
    Pop number one single in 1973.</p>
      <p>This song was conceived by then-unproven songwriter and
    producer Michael Masser, who had been recruited by Motown CEO,
    Berry Gordy, and A&amp;R chief, Suzanne de Passe, to create
    another huge hit recording three years after Ross' successful
    solo debut album, for which she recorded a 1970 cover of
    Ashford and Simpson's "Ain't No Mountain High Enough". Masser
    teamed up with the proven ballad lyricist Ron Miller to write
    this song.</p>
      <p>According to Masser, in a video documentary about Ross, the
    singer "always tried to push hard to get the vocals right for
    this particular song", calling it a "draining experience" that
    resulted in several near-emotional breakdowns by Ross when she
    felt the song wasn't up to her abilities. The song was recorded
    in the early morning hours, as was Diana Ross' custom after she
    began raising her children. According to Ross' second-oldest
    daughter, Tracee Ellis Ross, during a Barbara Walters Mother's
    Day interview special, her mother would put them to bed, record
    all evening, in order to wake her children &amp; send them to
    school the next morning. At this time, Mrs. Ernestine Ross,
    Diana's mother, handled the evening babysitting duties.</p>
      <p>Motown released the song as a single and the song hit number
    one on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, becoming Ross'
    longest-charting record, remaining on the chart for 21 weeks.
    It also spent a week at #1 on the adult contemporary chart, the
    singer's first #1 on this chart. Sherlie Matthews, Clydie King
    and Venetta Fields sang background vocals for Miss Ross's
    recording.</p>
      <p>This song marked a turning point in both the careers of
    Diana Ross and Mr. Masser as it reinvigorated Ross's singing
    career coming immediately after her Academy Award nomination
    for Best Actress for her acting debut in 
    <i>Lady Sings the Blues</i>, and it introduced Masser to an
    audience that would become accustomed to his prowess at writing
    good love songs.</p>
