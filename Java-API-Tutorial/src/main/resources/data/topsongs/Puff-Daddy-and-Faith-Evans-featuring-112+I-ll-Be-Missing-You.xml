      <p>"I'll Be Missing You" is a Grammy Award Winning song and hit
    single recorded by Puff Daddy and Faith Evans featuring 112, in
    memory of fellow Bad Boy Records artist Notorious B.I.G. who
    was murdered on March 9, 1997. Released as the second single
    from Puff Daddy and the Family's 
    <i>No Way Out</i>album, "I'll Be Missing You" sampled the
    melody of The Police's "Every Breath You Take" from 1983.</p>
      <p>The song was listed at #84 on 
    <i>Billboard's Greatest Songs of All Time.</i>
      </p>
      <p>The song, a rap ballad, had already been completed before
    permission was granted to use the sample from the 1983 song. As
    well as these artists, Sting (vocalist from The Police) joined
    in at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards. Sting owns 100% of the
    publishing royalties. The single however was not written by
    Puff Daddy but by Terry "Sauce Money" Carroll, a rapper from
    the Marcy Projects in Brooklyn who received a Grammy for his
    efforts in 1997.</p>
      <p>As well as using the melody and arrangement of "Every Breath
    You take" the single also borrows the melody from the
    well-known American spiritual "I'll Fly Away."</p>
      <p>There are several different versions of this song. One being
    an extended version (choir at beginning), another without the
    choir and an instrumental version. In the extended version, the
    song the choir is heard singing in the beginning is "Adagio for
    Strings" by Samuel Barber.</p>
      <p>A slightly altered version of the song was performed by
    Diddy at the Concert for Diana in Wembley, United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>"I'll Be Missing You" topped many charts across the world.
    It reached number one in the U.S., UK, Australia, Canada,
    Germany, Italy, Netherlands, and New Zealand. This song is one
    of the few to debut at #1 in the U.S. on the Hot 100.</p>
      <p>The song re-entered the UK Singles Chart at #32 on July 8,
    2007, ten years after it had its full physical release and 10
    years after it was #1.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Blender</i>magazine ranked the song at #25 on its list of
    the "50 Worst Songs Ever", calling it "a nauseating brew of of
    gloopy sentimentality and strategic-marketing mawkishness."</p>
