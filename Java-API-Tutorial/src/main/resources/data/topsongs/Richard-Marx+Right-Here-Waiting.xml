      <p>"Right Here Waiting" is a ballad recorded by Richard Marx on
    his second album, 
    <i>Repeat Offender</i>. "Right Here Waiting" hit number one on
    the Billboard Hot 100. It also made it to #2 in the UK.</p>
      <p>"Right Here Waiting" was the second single from 
    <i>Repeat Offender</i>, after "Satisfied". Marx wrote it on the
    road as a love letter to his wife, actress Cynthia Rhodes, who
    was in South Africa shooting for a film. In an era of power
    ballads, "Right Here Waiting" distinguished itself by its
    understatement; the track was arranged by Marx with Jeffery
    (C.J.) Vanston to feature none of the heavy drums and synth
    popular at the time, with Marx's vocal accompanied only by
    guitar (by Bruce Gaitsch) and keyboards (by Vanston). It is one
    of Marx's most frequently covered compositions.</p>
      <p>"Right Here Waiting" debuted on the Billboard Hot 100
    singles chart at #44, the week of July 8, 1989, and became his
    third consecutive #1 single on August 12, 1989. Certified Gold
    on August 21, the record spent three consecutive weeks at the
    summit, dislodged by Paula Abdul's "Cold Hearted", the week of
    September 2, 1989. The song was his first of several to go to
    #1 on the Hot Adult Contemporary Chart. Certified Platinum on
    October 16, 1989, "Right Here Waiting" is Marx's best selling
    single. It is also his most enduring, charting in the top 15 of
    Billboard's Hot Adult Contemporary Recurrents chart for four
    years running—from 2000-2003, more than ten years after its
    release.</p>
      <p>In the UK the song was released in September 1989 and peaked
    at #2.</p>
      <p>"Right Here Waiting" is an R&amp;B song from Monica's second
    studio album 
    <i>The Boy Is Mine</i>and features R&amp;B band 112. It was
    released as the album's seventh and final single in late 1999,
    only in the US, as a promotional vinyl. No music video was made
    for the song.</p>
