      <p>"Mack the Knife" or "The Ballad of Mack the Knife",
    originally "Die Moritat von Mackie Messer", is a song composed
    by Kurt Weill with lyrics by Bertolt Brecht for their music
    drama 
    <i>Die Dreigroschenoper</i>, or, as it is known in English, 
    <i>The Threepenny Opera</i>. It premiered in Berlin in 1928.
    The song has become a popular standard.</p>
      <p>A 
    <i>moritat</i>(from 
    <i>mori</i>meaning "deadly" and 
    <i>tat</i>meaning "deed") is a medieval version of the murder
    ballad performed by strolling minstrels. In 
    <i>The Threepenny Opera</i>, the moritat singer with his street
    organ introduces and closes the drama with the tale of the
    deadly 
    <i>Mackie Messer</i>, or 
    <i>Mack the Knife</i>, a character based on the dashing
    highwayman 
    <i>Macheath</i>in John Gay's 
    <i>The Beggar's Opera</i>. The Brecht-Weill version of the
    character was far more cruel and sinister, and has been
    transformed into a modern anti-hero.</p>
      <p>The play opens with the moritat singer comparing Macheath
    (unfavorably) with a shark, and then telling tales of his
    robberies, murders, rapes, and arson.</p>
      <p>The song was inserted in the play shortly before its
    premiere in 1928, because Harald Paulsen, who created the role
    of 
    <i>Macheath</i>, wished a more effectful introduction of his
    character. The original German text is:</p>
      <p>At the 1928 premiere, the Moritat was sung by Kurt Gerron,
    who was a noted film and stage actor in Germany, and who also
    played the part of the Police Chief Brown. Weill also intended
    for the Moritat to be accompanied by a barrel organ, which was
    to be played by the singer.</p>
      <p>In the best known English translation, from the Marc
    Blitzstein 1954 version of 
    <i>The Threepenny Opera</i>, which introduced the song to
    English-speaking audiences, the words are:</p>
      <p>This is the version popularized by Louis Armstrong (1956)
    and Bobby Darin (1959) (Darin's lyrics differ slightly), and
    most subsequent swing versions. Weill's widow, Lotte Lenya, the
    star of both the original 1928 German production and the 1954
    Blitzstein Broadway version, was present in the studio during
    Armstrong's recording. He spontaneously added her name to the
    lyrics, which already named several of Macheath's female
    victims.</p>
      <p>The rarely-heard final verse—not included in the original
    play, but added by Brecht for the 1930 movie—expresses the
    theme, and compares the glittering world of the rich and
    powerful with the dark world of the poor:</p>
      <p>In 1976 the version translated by Ralph Manheim and John
    Willett opened on Broadway, later made into a movie version
    starring Raúl Juliá as "Mackie". Here is an excerpt:</p>
      <p>This is the version later performed by Sting and Nick Cave.
    It is also the version performed by Lyle Lovett on the
    soundtrack of the film 
    <i>Quiz Show</i>(1994)—the same movie features Darin's
    rendition over the opening credits.</p>
      <p>A much darker translation by Robert David MacDonald and
    Jeremy Sams into English was used for the 1994 Donmar Warehouse
    theatrical production in London. The new translation attempted
    to recapture the original tone of the song:</p>
      <p>The song attributes many crimes to Macheath:</p>
      <p>The arson, rape and disappearance of the cabbie were omitted
    from the original cast recording of the Blitzstein version, but
    remain intact in the libretto.</p>
      <p>"Mack the Knife" was introduced to the United States hit
    parade by Louis Armstrong in 1956, but the song is most closely
    associated with Bobby Darin, who recorded his version at Fulton
    Studios on West 40th Street, New York City, on December 19,
    1958 (with Tom Dowd engineering the recording). In 1959 Darin's
    version reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and number
    six on the Black Singles chart, and earned him a Grammy Award
    for Record of the Year. Dick Clark had advised Darin not to
    record the song because of the perception that, having come
    from an opera, it wouldn't appeal to the rock &amp; roll
    audience. To this day, Clark recounts the story with good
    humor. Frank Sinatra, who recorded the song with Jimmy Buffett,
    called Darin's the "definitive" version. Darin's version hit #3
    on 
    <i>Billboard's All Time Top 100.</i>In 2003, the Darin version
    was ranked #251 on 
    <i>Rolling Stone'</i>s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All
    Time. On BBC Radio 4's 
    <i>Desert Island Discs</i>, pop mogul Simon Cowell named "Mack
    the Knife" the best song ever written.</p>
      <p>Brecht's original German language version was appropriated
    for a series of humorous and surreal blackout skits by
    television pioneer Ernie Kovacs, showing, between skits, the
    vibrating soundtrack line.</p>
      <p>Ella Fitzgerald made a famous live recording in 1960
    (released on 
    <i>Ella in Berlin: Mack the Knife</i>) in which, after
    forgetting the lyrics after the first verse, she improvised new
    lyrics in a performance that earned her a Grammy Award. Robbie
    Williams also recorded the song on his 2001 album 
    <i>Swing When You're Winning</i>. Other notable versions
    include performances by Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Tony Bennett,
    Marianne Faithfull, Nick Cave, Brian Setzer, Kevin Spacey,
    Westlife, and Michael Bublé. Swiss band The Young Gods
    radically reworked the song in industrial style, while jazz
    legend Sonny Rollins recorded an instrumental version entitled
    simply "Moritat" in 1956. A 1959 instrumental performance by
    Bill Haley &amp; His Comets was the final song the group
    recorded for Decca Records. Tito Puente also recorded an
    instrumental version. Salsa musician Rubén Blades recorded an
    homage entitled "Pedro Navaja." Brazilian composer Chico
    Buarque, in his adaptation of 
    <i>Threepenny Opera</i>(
    <i>Ópera do Malandro</i>), made two versions called "A Volta do
    Malandro" and "O Malandro No. 2", with lyrics in
    Portuguese.</p>
      <p>The song has been put to many other uses. American parodists
    the Capitol Steps used the tune for their song "Pack the Knife"
    in their 2002 album 
    <i>When Bush Comes to Shove</i>. In the mid-1980s, fast food
    giant McDonald's introduced "Mac Tonight", a character whose
    signature song was based on "Mack the Knife." Comedian Steve
    Martin famously parodied "Mack the Knife" in his opening
    monologue to the premiere of 
    <i>Saturday Night Live's</i>third season in 1977.</p>
