      <p>"Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Babe" is a song written,
    recorded and produced by Barry White. Released as the first
    single from White's album 
    <i>Can't Get Enough</i>in 1974, the song topped the Hot 100 and
    U.S. R&amp;B chart and has since become one of White's
    signature tunes. It was his second U.S. chart-topper, after
    "Love's Theme".</p>
      <p>The song is a pop-soul track with lush string arrangements
    and a disco-influenced beat behind it.</p>
      <p>"Can't Get Enough of Your Love" was covered by Taylor Dayne
    (slightly retitled, losing the "Babe") in 1993. Released as the
    first single from her third album 
    <i>Soul Dancing</i>, Dayne's version was produced by the team
    of David Cole and Robert Clivill√©s (otherwise known as C+C
    Music Factory).</p>
      <p>Dayne's version was well-received, getting heavy rotation on
    VH-1 and MTV and peaked at #20 on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot 100.</p>
