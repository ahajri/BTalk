      <p>"Abracadabra" is a well-recognized song recorded by the
    Steve Miller Band.</p>
      <p>Released as the main single from 
    <i>Abracadabra</i>in June 1982, it became a number-one hit on
    the United States 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot 100 chart, and also hit number two on the
    UK charts. It followed Survivor's "Eye of the Tiger" (from 
    <i>Rocky III</i>) on the Hot 100, and preceded Chicago's "Hard
    to Say I'm Sorry". After Chicago's ballad ended its two-week
    stay at number one, "Abracadabra" re-assumed the top spot on
    the U.S. charts for an additional week on September 25. John
    Cougar's "Jack and Diane" dislodged the Steve Miller Band's
    final number-one hit from the top on October 2.</p>
      <p>The song is said to have been inspired by the American
    singer Diana Ross with whom the band met filming TV shows in
    the 1960's.</p>
      <p>This song holds the record for the biggest drop out of the
    Top 10/Top 40 on the Hot 100. In the fall of 1982, as the song
    was moving down the chart, "Abracadabra" fell 38 spots from #10
    to #48 in one week.</p>
      <p>The song is listed at #70 on 
    <i>Billboard's Greatest Songs of all time.</i>[1]</p>
      <p>Cover versions of the song have been performed by Sugar Ray
    on their album 
    <i>14:59</i>and by Mike Chapman Band. A live version by the
    Belgian band Das Pop appeared on there 2004 DVD-single 
    <i>Love is Fair</i>.</p>
      <p>A version lasting 3 minutes and 41 seconds appears on a CD
    of Songs hand-picked by Guy Fieri titled 
    <i>Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives:Road Songs That Rock</i>
      </p>
      <p>Another CD that has the single version is from the Time-Life
    Label 
    <i>Sounds of the Eighties: 1980â€“1982</i>.</p>
