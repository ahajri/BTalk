      <p>"Let Your Love Flow" is the title of a pop song written by
    Larry E. Williams, a former roadie for Neil Diamond, and made
    popular by the American country music duo The Bellamy Brothers.
    It was offered to Neil Diamond first, but he turned it down.
    Howard Bellamy told Songfacts: "Well, it really wasn't in Neil
    Diamond's vein." He added: "But when we heard it we had an idea
    of how we wanted to record it because it kind of fit our style,
    acoustic bass with a groove, and I think that has a lot to do
    with it. You've got to really match songs with artists, and I
    think it was the perfect song for us, a great match." This
    record was a crossover hit in the United States, reaching
    Number One on the 1976 Billboard Hot 100 charts, #2 on Hot
    Adult Contemporary Tracks, and #21 on Hot Country Singles. It
    was also an international hit, landing on the charts in Great
    Britain, Scandinavia and Germany, where the Bellamy Brothers'
    record spent five weeks at #1 followed by 
    <i>"Ein Bett im Kornfeld"</i>, a German language adaptation of
    the song recorded by JÃ¼rgen Drews, which spent the next six
    weeks at #1. In 2008 the song was used in an advert in the
    United Kingdom for Barclaycard. Subsequently, the song
    re-entered the UK Singles Chart and peaked at #21.</p>
