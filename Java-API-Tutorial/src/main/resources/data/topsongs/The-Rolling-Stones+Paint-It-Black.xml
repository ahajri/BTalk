      <p>"Paint It Black" is a song by The Rolling Stones. The song
    was released as the first and only single from their fourth
    album 
    <i>Aftermath</i>(1966).</p>
      <p>The song was written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards,
    though Brian Jones contributed to the song's signature riff.
    Bill Wyman claims in his books that the song was a collective
    effort of the group, a 'Nanker-Phelge' one, but mistakenly
    credited to Jagger/Richards at the end.</p>
      <p>The single reached number one in both the U.S. and the U.K.
    charts in 1966. In 2004 it was ranked #174 on 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs
    of All Time. In the U.S., it was the first #1 pop single to
    feature a sitar on the recording.</p>
      <p>The song title is most often given as "Paint It Black"
    without the comma. This variant has appeared on some reissues
    and compilations. Richards has stated that the song was not
    intended to have a comma in its title, and that it was added by
    the record label.</p>
      <p>The song began with Wyman playing organ at a recording
    session, in parody of the group's former co-manager Eric
    Easton, who had been an organist. Charlie Watts accompanied the
    organ by playing a vaguely Middle Eastern drum part; Watts'
    drum pattern became the basis for the final song. Brian Jones
    contributed the song's signature sitar riff (having taught
    himself to play after a visit with George Harrison) and
    acoustic guitar, and Jagger contributed the lyrics, seemingly
    about a man mourning his dead girlfriend. The lead electric
    guitar and the background vocals are provided by Richards. The
    piano is played by Jack Nitzsche.</p>
      <p>The bass was also overdubbed by Bill Wyman playing on the
    bass pedals of a Hammond B3 organ.</p>
      <p>One of the Stones' early hit videos was "Paint in Black"
    filmed in a club. Brian Jones is not seen with a sitar in the
    video but instead is seen with a normal electric guitar.</p>
      <p>In recent years, the song was used in the ending credits of 
    <i>Full Metal Jacket</i>and the opening credits of 
    <i>Tour of Duty</i>. It was also used in 2004 in an
    episode-ending montage in the NBC television show 
    <i>American Dreams</i>, when a major character went missing in
    Vietnam. In the BBC Top Gear Vietnam special, aired in December
    2008 the song is played briefly after an American decorated
    motorbike is unveiled as a threat to the presenters.</p>
      <p>Its other film appearances include 
    <i>For Love of the Game</i>and 1997's 
    <i>The Devil's Advocate</i>, played during the closing credits.
    The pilot of 
    <i>Nip/Tuck</i>TV show also uses the Rolling Stones' version of
    the song. The song, as covered by Gob, was also featured in the
    film 
    <i>Stir of Echoes</i>. The Gob cover also plays over the end
    credits of the 2004 mini-series of 
    <i>Salem's Lot</i>. A French version of the song, recorded by
    Marie Laforêt, appears in both 
    <i>The Devil's Advocate</i>and the 2006 film 
    <i>Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby</i>, and an
    alternative version appears on commercials for 
    <i>The Sopranos</i>on A&amp;E.</p>
      <p>"Paint It Black" was also used in six video game titles. 
    <i>Conflict: Vietnam</i>used the song during the opening
    sequence, while 
    <i>Twisted Metal: Black</i>used the beginning of the song in
    the opening screen, then the whole song again in its end
    credits, and inserted into level music throughout moments of
    gameplay. A version of the karaoke game 
    <i>SingStar</i>also features "Paint It Black". The song is also
    featured in 
    <i>Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock</i>as a playable track,
    with an extended ending to avoid fading out like the original
    did (the game makes use of the master track). However, it is
    unable to be played in Co-op mode, as the bass and guitar
    tracks could not be separated (this can be heard in
    single-player mode also; when one makes a mistake, both the
    guitar and bass cut out). It is also heard playing on some
    static radios in the Eve of Destruction total conversion for 
    <i>Battlefield 1942</i>, 
    <i>Battlefield: Vietnam</i>and 
    <i>Battlefield 2</i>. In addition, it was used in the
    television commercial for Vietcong: Purple Haze. 
    <i>Karaoke Revolution Presents: American Idol Encore
    2</i>allows players to sing it and unlock a video of it being
    performed on 
    <i>American Idol</i>.</p>
      <p>Isaac Brock's indie side project Ugly Casanova has referred
    to the song in "Barnacles".</p>
      <p>
         <i>American Idol</i>Top 6 covered a short version of this for
    the Ford music video.</p>
      <p>At 0:48 in the song "At This Hour" on the Spin Doctors' 
    <i>Turn It Upside Down</i>album, they sing "You see a red door
    and you want to paint it black", a reference to this song.</p>
      <p>The 1972 song "Thirteen" on the Big Star album 
    <i>#1 Record</i>contains the lyrics "Won't you tell your dad to
    get off my back/Tell him what we said about 'Paint It Black.'
    "</p>
      <p>Prior to being banned from 
    <i>The Howard Stern Show</i>, Crazy Cabbie was often introduced
    to his own theme song, a variation of "Paint It Black",
    although with lyrics mocking Cabbie.</p>
      <p>In the Stephen King series 
    <i>The Dark Tower</i>, "Paint It Black" is heard by several
    characters as they pass the same music shop in New York at
    different time periods.</p>
      <p>The Kaiser Chiefs' song "Heat Dies Down" is loosely based on
    the guitar riff of "Paint It Black".</p>
      <p>In Good Charlotte's song "All Black", from their fourth
    album 
    <i>Good Morning Revival</i>, the line "...like the Rolling
    Stones wanna paint it black" refers to the song.</p>
      <p>In The Dresden Dolls' song, "Jeep", Amanda sings "I see a
    red jeep and I want to paint it black" in reference to the
    "Paint It Black" line "I see a red door and I want to paint it
    black".</p>
      <p>The second chapter in Alan Moore's 
    <i>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume III:
    Century</i>is set in 1966 and titled "Paint it Black".</p>
      <p>The song "Welcome to the Black Parade" by My Chemical
    Romance makes reference to it in the line "... so paint it
    black and take it back..."</p>
      <p>Japanese pop star Hikaru Utada revamps the first line at the
    end of "Amai Wana: Paint It, Black".</p>
      <p>Janet Fitch's 2006 novel 
    <i>Paint It Black</i>is named after the song; also, the quote
    before the first chapter is the first four lines of the Rolling
    Stones song.</p>
      <p>The music website Last.FM has two skins, Simply Red and
    Paint It Black.</p>
      <p>The Lee Mead version of "Paint It Black" was used by Vincent
    Simone &amp; Louisa Lytton due to represent the United Kingdom
    at the 2008 Eurovision Dance Contest.</p>
      <p>The web comic Order of the Stick, strip #635, is entitled,
    "I See a Red Robe and I Want to Paint it Black", clearly in
    reference to this song.</p>
      <p>In “The Christmas Show” episode of 
    <i>Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</i>, Studio 60 co-executive
    producer Matt Albie (Matthew Perry) is complimenting Studio 60
    cast member Harriet Hayes (Sarah Paulson) on being cast as
    Anita Pallenberg in a new movie about the Rolling Stones. He
    says “…you’re great casting for that…It’s a great part. Brian,
    Keith, Mick Jagger – they all considered her a musical
    confidante. ‘Paint It Black’ was all her.”</p>
      <p>The song was once used in a promotional campaign for the All
    Blacks by one of their corporate sponsors, Steinlager beer, in
    the late 1990s.</p>
      <p>The song was used as the entrance song for Johny Hendricks
    at UFC 101.</p>
      <p>The third book in the Sonja Blue series (
    <i>Midnight Blue: The Sonja Blue Collection</i>), by Nancy A.
    Collins, is titled 
    <i>Paint It Black</i>.</p>
      <p>Before Eric Burdon &amp; War's 1970 version reached the
    charts in Netherlands, Eric Burdon &amp; The Animals covered it
    in 1967 for their debut album, 
    <i>Winds of Change</i>. The original album version of Eric
    Burdon &amp; War had a length of 13:41.</p>
      <p>Eric Burdon &amp; The Animals performed it at the Monterey
    Pop Festival in 1967. This version was cut and included in the
    motion picture of the festival. They performed it also on the
    BBC.</p>
      <p>In 1969 the song was a highlight performed live by Eric
    Burdon &amp; War. After releasing their first album they
    recorded shortly a second featuring "Paint It Black medley"
    with a length of over 13 minutes. In 1971 they released it as a
    single.</p>
      <p>Eric Burdon performed it also on his "Hippiefest" tour in
    2008.</p>
