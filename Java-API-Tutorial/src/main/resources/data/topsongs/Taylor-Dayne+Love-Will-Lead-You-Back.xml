      <p>"Love Will Lead You Back" is a song performed by Taylor
    Dayne. Released as the second single from Dayne's second album 
    <i>Can't Fight Fate</i>(following the more uptempo "With Every
    Beat of My Heart"), the ballad debuted on the Billboard Hot 100
    chart on January 27, 1990. It reached number one on April 7
    that same year and spent 15 weeks in the Top 40. It also
    reached number one on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Adult Contemporary chart and was certified Gold
    in the U.S. by the RIAA.</p>
      <p>The song, written by Diane Warren, is about a woman who is
    willing to set her lover free because she is confident that one
    day his love will lead him back to her: "
    <i>Sometimes it takes some time out on your own now / to find
    your way back home</i>". Warren has stated that she began
    writing the song while in a hotel in Russia, and that she had
    originally intended the song to be offered to R&amp;B singer
    Whitney Houston, but Arista Records president Clive Davis
    wanted to let Dayne record the song.</p>
      <p>The video was very simple; it shows Dayne and her band in a
    studio performing the song. The video was released both in
    black-and-white and sepia tones. In the video, Dayne holds in
    her hand what seems to be the lyrics of the song, or possibly a
    letter from her lover.</p>
      <p>The song was covered by Filipina singers Kyla and Nina
    Girado, by Mexican pop singer Yuri, as well as American R&amp;B
    singer Patti LaBelle and Australian pop group Young Divas.</p>
