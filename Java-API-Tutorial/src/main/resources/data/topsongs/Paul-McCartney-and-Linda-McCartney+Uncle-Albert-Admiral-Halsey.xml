      <p>"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey" is a song by Paul and Linda
    McCartney from the album 
    <i>Ram</i>. Released in the United States as a single on 2
    August 1971, it reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in
    August 1971. The song is probably the most ambitious and
    experimental track on 
    <i>Ram</i>, and is less a song and more a collection of melodic
    fragments pieced together, in a similar way to the song-cycle
    on the second half of The Beatles' 
    <i>Abbey Road</i>. Paul McCartney won the Grammy Award for Best
    Arrangement Accompanying Vocalists in 1971 for the song.</p>
      <p>The song is noted for its sound effects, including the sound
    of thunder, lightning, and rain, heard between the first and
    second verse, the sound of a telephone dialing, and a message
    machine, heard after the second verse, and a sound of chirping
    sea birds and wind by the seashore. Linda's voice is heard in
    the harmonies as well as the bridge section of the "Admiral
    Halsey" portion of the song.</p>
      <p>McCartney said "Uncle Albert" was based on his uncle. "He's
    someone I recall fondly, and when the song was coming it was
    like a nostalgia thing." McCartney also said, "As for Admiral
    Halsey, he's one of yours, an American admiral", referring to
    Admiral William "Bull" Halsey.</p>
