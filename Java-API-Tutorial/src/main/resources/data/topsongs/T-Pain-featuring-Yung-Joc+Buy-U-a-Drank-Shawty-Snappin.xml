    Cent's "Just a Lil Bit". At the end of the second verse, T-Pain
    says 'On That Patr√≥n You Should Get Like Me', referencing Yung
    Joc's "It's Goin' Down" off his album 
    <i>New Joc City</i>. Later on in the song, T-Pain takes a line
    from the single by Unk, "Walk It Out" when he says, "...Walk it
    out." The song also includes uncredited vocals by T-Pain's
    Nappy Boy artists, Tay Dizm and Jay Lyriq. Jay Lyriq sings:
    "Let's get gone, walk it out....Now rock, rock, rock, rock, you
    can do it all by yourself", and Tay Dizm sings: "Now walk it
    out, think about it... Ah snap!". The song ranks 63rd on
