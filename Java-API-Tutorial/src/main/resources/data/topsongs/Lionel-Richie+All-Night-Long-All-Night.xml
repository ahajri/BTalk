      <p>"All Night Long (All Night)" was a 1983 hit single for
    Lionel Richie. Taken from his second solo album 
    <i>Can't Slow Down</i>, it combined Richie's soulful Commodores
    style with Caribbean influences and contains an old Jamaican
    chant. This new, more dance approach proved popular, as the
    single reached number one on both the soul singles and Hot 100
    . and number two on the UK Singles Chart (for 3 weeks) being
    kept off by Billy Joel's "Uptown Girl". According to an episode
    of 
    <i>Reading Rainbow</i>in which Richie guest-starred, the song's
    theme is about a party that lasts all night long.</p>
      <p>An accompanying music video was produced by former Monkee
    and TV video pioneer Michael Nesmith.</p>
      <p>Richie performed the song at the closing ceremony of the
    1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California. He also
    performed the song as the concert's finale at the Nobel Peace
    Prize Concert in 2006 in Oslo, Norway.</p>
      <p>The song was featured in the pilot of as Ricardo Tubbs
    (Philip Michael Thomas) walks across the dance floor to the
    boss that killed his brother. In 2006, this song was used in a
    commercial promoting Mountain Dew MDX. In 2007, a cover of this
    song was used in a commercial for the Conrad Jupiters Hotel and
    Casino; it was also broadcast over IndyFM TV between races at
    the 2007 Gold Coast Indy 300. The Cheetah Girls song "Fuego"
    sampled parts from this song. The bridge section of the song
    was also sampled heavily in Cry India a 1995 hit by UK dance
    act Umboza</p>
      <p>U.S. military personnel told Richie that "All Night Long
    (All Night)" was playing in the nighttime streets of Baghdad
    during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.</p>
      <p>He performed the song to a television audience of over 28
    million at the American Idol 2009 grand finale, alongside
    3rd-placed contestant, Danny Gokey.</p>
      <p>Jason Mraz performs a cover of the song on his Jason Mraz's
    Beautiful Mess - Live On Earth album.</p>
