      <p>"She Drives Me Crazy" is a song recorded by the Fine Young
    Cannibals, included on their 1989 album 
    <i>The Raw and the Cooked</i>. The song peaked at #5 in the
    band's native UK in January 1989 before hitting #1 on the
    Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. on April 15, 1989. It also made
    number 3 on the Dutch Top 40. A remixed version was released in
    1997.</p>
      <p>During a short time in 1999, the song was used temporarily
    (because of legal issues with the theme song) as the theme for
    Rush Limbaugh's radio show, and is currently used by WSB
    Radio's Clark Howard.</p>
      <p>The unique snare drum "pop" sound was created by recording
    the snare drum portion separately. A speaker was then placed on
    top of the snare drum, and a microphone below. The original
    recording of the snare drum part was played back through the
    speaker and re-recorded.</p>
      <p>This song is one of five songs played on the main menu of
    the arcade game compilation Namco Museum 50th Anniversary.</p>
      <p>Two music videos were produced for the video, one by
    Philippe Decouflé and one by Pedro Romhanyi. Similar to
    Decouflé's only other music video, New Order's "True Faith",
    his version includes extensive choreography and performers in
    unusual costumes, including two identical dancers with
    completely different colored-outfits, as well as a person with
    a television on their head. This version received several
    nominations at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards, including Best
    Video.</p>
      <p>Dolly Parton recorded a cover of the song for her 2008
    album, 
    <i>Backwoods Barbie</i>, titled "Drives Me Crazy." It was
    released as a single to Adult Contemporary stations in January
    2009.</p>
      <p>The song was parodied twice: In 1989, by "Weird Al" Yankovic
    as "She Drives Like Crazy" on the soundtrack album "UHF"; and
    in 1991 by Guns and Moses as "They Drive me Brady", which
    featured audio snippets of 
    <i>The Brady Bunch.</i>
      </p>
      <p>The Muppets parodied the song with additional lyrics by Jim
    Lewis for the 1994 album Kermit Unpigged.[1] A music video
    (directed by Jim Yukich) featured cameo appearances by
    celebrities such as Fran Drescher, John Landis, Ozzy Osbourne,
    Phil Collins, Pam Tillis, David Hasselhoff and Helen Hunt. In
    the UK version there were still some American stars, but it was
    edited to include more of Ozzy Osbourne, along with some UK
    stars like Gloria Hunniford and even a member of
    Eastenders.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Sesame Street</i>parodied the song 
    <i>and</i>the group performing it as "C Drives Me Crazy" by the
    "Fine Young Camels".</p>
      <p>British a cappella group The Flying Pickets covered the song
    on the album 
    <i>The Original Flying Pickets</i>.</p>
