      <p>"Sister Golden Hair" is a popular song written by Gerry
    Beckley and recorded by the band America for their fifth album 
    <i>Hearts</i>(1975). It was their second single to reach number
    one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, remaining in the top
    position for just one week.</p>
      <p>The song, while immensely popular, was criticized in
    conservative circles as a plea for common law marriage and
    living in sin.</p>
      <p>As the second number one single from the group America, this
    song cemented their popularity and the song continues to turn
    up on oldies programs, and is a popular request.</p>
