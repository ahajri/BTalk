      <p>"Taking a Chance on Love" is a popular song by Vernon Duke
    with lyrics by John Latouche and Ted Fetter, published in 1940
    (see 1940 in music), which has become a standard recorded by
    many artists. It was introduced in the 1940 show 
    <i>Cabin in the Sky</i>, a ground-breaking Broadway musical
    with an all black cast, where it was performed by Ethel Waters
    and Dooley Wilson. The re-released Benny Goodman version
    featuring Helen Forrest reached #1 in 1943.</p>
