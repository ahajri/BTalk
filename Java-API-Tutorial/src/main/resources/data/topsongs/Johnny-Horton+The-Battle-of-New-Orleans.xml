      <p>"The Battle of New Orleans" is the name of a song written by
    Jimmie Driftwood. The song details the 1815 Battle of New
    Orleans from the perspective of an American fighting alongside
    Andrew Jackson against British forces, but the tone is
    lighthearted. It has been recorded by many artists, but the one
    most often associated with this song is Johnny Horton. His
    version topped the Billboard Hot 100 in 1959 (see 1959 in
    music).</p>
      <p>In 
    <i>Billboard</i>magazine's rankings of the top songs in the
    first fifty years of the Billboard Hot 100 chart, "The Battle
    of New Orleans" was ranked as the twenty-eighth song overall
    and the number-one country song to appear on the chart.</p>
      <p>The melody has its roots in a well-known American fiddle
    tune "The 8th of January", which was the date of the Battle of
    New Orleans. Jimmie Driftwood, a school principal in Arkansas
    with a passion for history, set a historical account of the
    battle to this music in an attempt to get students interested
    in learning history. It worked, and Driftwood became well known
    in the region for his historical songs. He was "discovered" in
    the late 1950s by Don Warden, and eventually signed to a
    recording contract by RCA, for whom he recorded 12 songs in
    1958, including "The Battle of New Orleans".</p>
      <p>"The Battle of New Orleans" is often played during North
    American sporting events, and is commonly heard during home
    games of the NHL's Calgary Flames.</p>
      <p>As noted, Johnny Horton's 1959 version is the best-known
    recording of the song, which omits the mild expletives and much
    of the historical references in the original. Horton also
    recorded an alternative version for release in British
    Commonwealth countries which had more favorable lyrics toward
    the British. The word "British" was replaced with "Rebels",
    along with a few other differences.</p>
      <p>Many other artists have recorded this song. Notable versions
    include the following:</p>
      <p>Country parodists Homer and Jethro had a hit when they
    parodied "The Battle of New Orleans" with their song "The
    Battle of Kookamonga." The single was released in 1959 and
    featured production work by Chet Atkins. In this version, the
    scene shifts from a battleground to a campground, with the
    combat being changed to the Boy Scouts chasing after the Girl
    Scouts.</p>
