      <p>"If You Don't Know Me by Now" is a song written by Kenny
    Gamble and Leon Huff and recorded by the Philadelphia soul
    musical group Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes, which became
    their first hit after being released as a single in 1972,
    topping the R&amp;B chart and peaking at number three on the
    Pop chart.</p>
      <p>The song was originally written for Labelle (a trio led by
    Patti LaBelle) but they never recorded it. After some
    revisions, the song was offered to The Dells but they also
    never recorded it. Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes signed to
    Gamble &amp; Huff's own Philadelphia International label in
    1971 and they did record the song, with the late Teddy
    Pendergrass as lead vocalist. In addition to the single
    release, the song was included on their eponymous debut
    album.</p>
      <p>Patti LaBelle made the song part of her concert repertoire
    in 1982. A live version appears on her 1985 album, 
    <i>Patti</i>.</p>
      <p>It was later covered by the English pop/soul band Simply
    Red, also becoming their best-known hit after reaching number
    one on the U.S. Hot 100 on July 15, 1989 and at number
    thirty-eight on the Hot Black Singles chart. It peaked at
    number two in the UK Singles Chart. It also topped the Canadian
    Singles Chart. Seal recorded the song for his 2008 album 
    <i>Soul</i>, and, in April 2009, it became his first top-ten
    Adult Contemporary hit since "Love's Divine" in 2004; the song
    was subsequently nominated for the Best Male Pop Vocal
    Performance Grammy</p>
      <p>The song was chosen as one of the Songs of the Century by
    the RIAA. It was featured at the end of Michael Apted's movie 
    <i>Class Action</i>.</p>
      <p>It was comically covered by British comedian Ricky Gervais
    in his character David Brent. A music video was produced and
    released with BBC's 
    <i>The Office</i>DVD set. 
    <i>American Idol</i>contestant LaToya London additionally
    covered the song in the season compilation album 
    <i>American Idol Season 3: Greatest Soul Classics</i>.</p>
      <p>R&amp;B/Pop singer Ciara sampled the chorus of the song for
    her 2009 single, "Never, Ever", featuring Young Jeezy. The
    single is from her third album 
    <i>Fantasy Ride</i>.</p>
      <p>This version of the song appears on the game Karaoke
    Revolution Presents:American Idol.</p>
