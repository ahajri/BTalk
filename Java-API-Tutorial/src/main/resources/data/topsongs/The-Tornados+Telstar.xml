      <p>"Telstar" –

</span>– is a 1962 instrumental record performed by The Tornados.
It was the first single by a British band to reach number one on
the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and was also a number one hit in the
UK. The record was named after the AT&amp;T communications
satellite Telstar, which went into orbit in July 1962. The song was
released five weeks later on 17 August 1962. It was written and
produced by Joe Meek, and featured a clavioline, a keyboard
instrument with a distinctive electronic sound. "Telstar" won an
Ivor Novello Award and is estimated to have sold at least five
million copies worldwide.</p>
      <p>This novelty record was intended to evoke the dawn of the
    space age, complete with sound effects that were meant to sound
    "space-like". A popular story at the time of the record's
    release was that the weird distortions and background noise
    came from sending the signal up to the Telstar satellite and
    re-recording it back on Earth. It is more likely that the
    effects were created in Meek's recording studio, which was a
    small flat above a shop in London. It has been claimed that the
    sounds intended to symbolize radio signals were produced by
    Meek running a pen around the rim of an ashtray, and that the
    "rocket blastoff" at the start of the record was actually a
    flushing toilet, with the recordings made to sound exotic by
    playing the tape in reverse at various speeds.</p>
      <p>A French composer, Jean Ledrut, accused Joe Meek of
    plagiarism, claiming that the tune of "Telstar" had been copied
    from "La Marche d'Austerlitz", a piece from a score that Ledrut
    had written for the 1960 film 
    <i>Austerlitz</i>. This led to a lawsuit that prevented Meek
    from receiving royalties from the record during his lifetime,
    and the issue was not resolved in Meek's favour until just
    three weeks after his death in 1967. It is unlikely that Meek
    was aware of 
    <i>Austerlitz</i>, as it had been released only in France at
    the time.</p>
      <p>Meek produced later in 1962 a vocal version of "Telstar"
    titled "Magic Star", sung by Kenny Hollywood. It was released
    as a single by Decca Records (cat. nr F11546), with on the
    B-side "The Wonderful Story of Love", written by Geoff Goddard.
    The musical direction for both songs was done by Ivor Raymonde
    . "Magic Star" was covered by Margie Singleton, released by
    Mercury Records (cat. nr 72079) in January 1963, backed with
    "Only Your Shadow Knows".</p>
      <p>Two Spanish vocal versions were released by Alberto Cortez
    and The Latin Quartet, titled "Magica Estrella."</p>
      <p>Poet and musician Robert Calvert wrote lyrics to accompany
    the song, which he performed in 1981.</p>
      <p>In 1986, Scottish duo The Knits sampled the original sounds
    and mixed them with text excerpts from Marx's "18th Brumaire of
    Louis Napoleon". Their song was called "Passivism".</p>
      <p>With French lyrics by Jacques Plante, the song was released
    by Les Compagnons de la Chanson under the title "Telstar - Une
    étoile en plein jour" 
    <i>(a star in broad daylight)</i>.</p>
      <p>Luxembourg-born German language singer Camillo Felgen
    recorded the German vocal version as "Telstar (Irgendwann
    Erwacht Ein Neuer Tag)" with lyrics by Carl Ulrich Blecher in
    1963.</p>
      <p>The record was an immediate hit after its release, remaining
    in the UK pop charts for 25 weeks, five of them at number one,
    and in the American charts for 16 weeks. "Telstar" was the
    first U.S. number one by a British group. Up to that point, and
    since World War II, there had only been three British names
    that topped the U.S. chart: in May 1962 "Stranger on the Shore"
    by clarinetist Mr. Acker Bilk; the second was "He's Got the
    Whole World in His Hands" by Laurie London (1958), whilst the
    first was "Auf Wiederseh'n Sweetheart" by Vera Lynn (1952). See
    List of songs by British artists which reached number-one on
    the Hot 100 (USA).</p>
