      <p>"A View to a Kill" is the thirteenth single by Duran Duran,
    released in May 1985.</p>
      <p>It was a stand-alone single, created for the James Bond
    movie 
    <i>A View to a Kill</i>, and it remains the only James Bond
    theme song to have reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100; it also
    made it to #2 for 3 weeks on the UK Singles Chart, held off the
    top spot by "19" by Paul Hardcastle. In 1986, John Barry and
    Duran Duran were nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best
    Original Song for 
    <i>A View to a Kill</i>. Many fans around the world acclaim it
    by its famous phrase, "Dance Into The Fire".</p>
      <p>The song was the last track that the original five members
    of Duran Duran recorded together until their reunion sixteen
    years later, in 2001. It was played at their final 1985
    performance together before splitting for the very first time,
    at Live Aid in Philadelphia. The single was at #1 on the
    Billboard Hot 100 at the time they performed it on that
    historic event.</p>
      <p>The song was written by Duran Duran and John Barry, and
    recorded at Maison Rouge Studio and CTS Studio in London with a
    60-piece orchestra.</p>
      <p>Duran Duran was chosen to do the song after bassist John
    Taylor (a lifelong Bond fan) approached producer Cubby Broccoli
    at a party, and somewhat drunkenly asked "When are you going to
    get someone 
    <i>decent</i>to do one of your theme songs?" This inauspicious
    beginning led to some serious talks, and the band was
    introduced to Bond composer John Barry, and also Jonathan Elias
    (whom Duran Duran members would later work with many times). An
    early writing meeting at Taylor's flat in Knightsbridge led to
    everyone getting drunk instead of composing.</p>
      <p>Singer Simon Le Bon said of Barry: "He didn't really come up
    with any of the basic musical ideas. He heard what we came up
    with and he put them into an order. And that's why it happened
    so quickly because he was able to separate the good ideas from
    the bad ones, and he arranged them. He has a great way of
    working brilliant chord arrangements. He was working with us as
    virtually a sixth member of the group, but not really getting
    on our backs at all."</p>
      <p>The song was finally completed in April 1985, and was
    released worldwide in May the same year.</p>
      <p>The song was accompanied by a tongue-in-cheek video filmed
    in June 1985. It was directed by the duo Godley &amp; Creme
    (who had also directed their 1981 video for "Girls on Film".)
    The video cast the band members as spies and assassins
    scampering all over the Eiffel Tower, in a rather tangled
    thicket of half-sketched storylines. Band members execute many
    actions: Roger Taylor sends out his probe-cams from inside his
    mobile HQ to patrol around the whole Eiffel Tower, Nick Rhodes
    takes pictures with his spy cam, John Taylor supposedly gives a
    "helping hand" to Bond (Roger Moore) by shooting at May Day
    (Grace Jones) with his hidden "binnoculars-camouflaged" gun
    while Andy Taylor directs his sonic accordion attacks upon Nick
    as Simon Le Bon wanders about, using a portable cassette player
    to set off a series of explosions elsewhere in the world. These
    shots are intercut with a few scenes taken from the 
    <i>A View to a Kill</i>film, including those featuring Moore
    and Jones on the Eiffel Tower, so that it appears the actors
    and the band are participating in the same storyline.</p>
      <p>At the end of the video, a woman approaches Le Bon asking
    him "Excuse me! And you?", then he finishes with a spoof of
    Bond's signature introduction, smarmily introducing himself:
    "Bon. Simon Le Bon." After saying this, he looks at his fake
    cassette player only to notice it programmed the Eiffel Tower
    to explode inmediately. However, instead of the entire tower
    collapsing, a postcard with a picture of Eiffel Tower, that is
    being sold at a tourist stand on the ground floor explodes as a
    gunbarrel closes to end the video.</p>
      <p>The b-side was an instrumental piece orchestrated by John
    Barry, titled "A View To A Kill (That Fatal Kiss)".</p>
      <p>It is thought that there was no 12" remix for the song
    because the band ran out of time. However, Capitol Records did
    commission and receive at least one remix of the track.</p>
      <p>In addition BBC Radio 1 (in the UK) played one extended
    version of the track which included the well-known "I expect
    you to die" quote from Goldfinger as a one-off promotion around
    the time the single was released. An unofficial DJ Service
    remix called "A View to a kill (Art of Mix)" has appeared on
    various DJ and bootleg compilations. There is also a fan-made
    remix which combines the whole Duran Duran's version with some
    sampled scores from its film and an orchestral score completely
    based upon that of the band's. It was named as "A View To A
    Kill (Saint Ken Extended Remix)".</p>
      <p>Cover versions have been recorded by popular Welsh band
    Lostprophets, Canadian punk band Gob, and Australian band
    Custard. In 2006 the Chilean band Los MOX! recorded a new and
    heavier version of the song for their album titled "... con
    cover" Another cover version of the song was created in 1985 by
    a euro disco group called DJ's Factory. This cover of 
    <i>A View to a Kill</i>has a more disco/house sound as compared
    to that of Duran Duran's. Shirley Bassey covered the song, as
    she did with all of the Bond songs (up to GoldenEye) for an
    album- however, she wasn't satisfied with the quality, so the
    album was never released. Finnish Melodic Death Metal band
    Diablo has covered the song, so has Finnish symphonic metal
    cover supergroup Northern Kings. In 2008, the song was covered
    with a bossa feeling by former Morcheeba singer Skye on the
    cover album 
    <i>Hollywood Mon Amour</i>.</p>
      <p>Måns Zelmerlöw performed a live version of the song at the
    beginning of the Andra Chansen round of Melodifestivalen 2010
    in Örebro, Sweden.</p>
