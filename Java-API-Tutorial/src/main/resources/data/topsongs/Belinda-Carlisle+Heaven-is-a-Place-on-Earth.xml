      <p>"Heaven Is a Place on Earth" is a song recorded by Belinda
    Carlisle, the lead singer of The Go-Go's. Written by Rick
    Nowels and Ellen Shipley, and interpolating the aria "Schlafe,
    mein Liebster, genie√üe der Ruh'" from Johann Sebastian Bach's 
    <i>Christmas Oratorio</i>, it hit Number One on the Billboard
    Hot 100 on December 5, 1987, becoming Carlisle's only U.S.
    chart-topper with or without The Go-Go's. A month later it hit
    number one on the UK Singles Chart and held the spot for two
    weeks. The song reached number one in many other countries,
    among them Switzerland, Ireland, Sweden, South Africa and
    Norway. The song also reached number three in Germany, number
    two in Australia, and number six in Italy. It is widely
    considered to be Carlisle's signature song due to its success
    on the charts, and how it has remained relevant even today. The
    song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop
    Vocal Performance.</p>
      <p>The promotional video was directed by Academy Award-winning
    actress Diane Keaton and features an appearance of Carlisle's
    husband Morgan Mason. Carlisle appeared wearing a sampo and
    later changed to a black off-the-shoulder blouse. The video was
    partially filmed at Six Flags Magic Mountain theme park in
    Valencia, California, on the Spin Out ride.</p>
      <p>Carlisle's backup vocalists on the track include songwriters
    Nowels and Shipley as well as Michelle Phillips of The Mamas
    &amp; the Papas and songwriter Diane Warren. It also featured
    Thomas Dolby on keyboards.</p>
