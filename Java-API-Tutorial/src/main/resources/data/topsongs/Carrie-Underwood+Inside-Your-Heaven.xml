      <p>"Inside Your Heaven" is a song written by Andreas Carlsson,
    Pelle Nylén, Savan Kotecha and produced by Desmond Child. Two
    versions of the song were released as singles in 2005 (see 2005
    in music): one by 
    <i>American Idol</i>winner Carrie Underwood, and another by 
    <i>Idol</i>runner-up Bo Bice.</p>
      <p>Underwood's recording of the song, released on June 14, 2005
    in the U.S., debuted at number one on the Canadian Singles
    Chart and on the U.S. Hot 100, where it remained for seven and
    one week, consecutively, atop the charts. It was the longest
    running single of 2005 in Canada. It was certified gold by the
    RIAA and two times platinum by the CRIA, and it was later
    included on her debut album, 
    <i>Some Hearts</i>. The B-side is a cover of the Martina
    McBride song "Independence Day". The song entered the UK
    Singles Chart at number forty-nine and moved up to forty-six
    the following week.</p>
      <p>Bice's version of "Inside Your Heaven" was released on June
    21, 2005 and peaked at number two on the Hot 100. It became the
    first 
    <i>American Idol</i>single in the history of 
    <i>Billboard</i>to replace the winner's song at number one on
    the Hot 100 Single Sales chart. It was certified gold by the
    RIAA. The B-side is a cover of the song "Vehicle" by Ides of
    March.</p>
      <p>The song won the Billboard Music Awards for "Top-Selling
    Country Single of the Year" and "Top-Selling Hot 100 Song of
    the Year" (Bice's version was also nominated in this category).
    It also helped Underwood win the award for "Country Single
    Sales Artist of the Year". Carrie Underwood's version sold
    821,000 copies, while Bo Bice's version sold 401,000.</p>
      <p>Inside Your Heaven was never released to country radio,
    however it charted on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart due
    to unsolicited airplay.</p>
