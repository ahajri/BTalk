      <p>"Shadow Dancing" is a song by Andy Gibb that reached number
    one for seven weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1978. According
    to 
    <i>Billboard's Book Of Number One Hits</i>, Gibb became the
    first solo artist in the history of the U.S. pop charts to have
    his first three singles hit the number-one spot. Additionally,
    "Shadow Dancing" was listed by Billboard as being the number
    one single of 1978. In additon the song peaked at number eleven
    on the soul chart .</p>
      <p>The song was written by Andy and his brothers (Barry,
    Maurice and Robin Gibb) in Los Angeles, while the trio of
    brothers were working on the film Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts
    Club Band. "And one night," Andy would recall, "while we were
    relaxing, we sat down and we had to start getting tracks
    together for the album" (also titled Shadow Dancing, which
    would eventually hit #7 on the U.S. album charts). "So we
    literally sat down and in ten minutes, we had a group going,
    (singing) the chorus part. As it says underneath the song, we
    all wrote it, the four of us."</p>
      <p>While Andy Gibb would have three more Top 10 hits in the
    U.S., this would be his final chart-topping hit in America.</p>
      <p>The song lists at #40 on 
    <i>Billboard's All Time Top 100.</i>[1]</p>
