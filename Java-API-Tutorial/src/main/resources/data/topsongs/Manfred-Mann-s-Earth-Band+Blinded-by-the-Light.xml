      <p>"Blinded by the Light" is a song written and originally
    recorded by Bruce Springsteen. It is best known for a #1 hit
    version recorded by Manfred Mann's Earth Band.</p>
      <p>"Blinded by the Light" was the first song on, and first
    single from, Bruce Springsteen's 1973 debut album 
    <i>Greetings from Asbury Park N.J.</i>Springsteen's version was
    initially unsuccessful, and failed to appear on the music
    charts.</p>
      <p>Manfred Mann's Earth Band released a version of the song on
    their album 
    <i>The Roaring Silence</i>. The song reached #1 on both 's Hot
    100 and on the Canadian chart on 19 February 1977. The Manfred
    Mann's Earth Band recording of "Blinded by the Light" is
    Springsteen's only Number 1 single as a songwriter on the Hot
    100. At the time, Manfred Mann's Earth Band set a Hot 100
    record for the group with the longest time between #1 hits.
    Manfred Mann had previously hit #1 with Do Wah Diddy Diddy in
    1964.</p>
      <p>The song is notable for lead vocalist Chris Thompson's
    garbled enunciation, especially of the phrase "revved up like a
    deuce" which has led many fans to interpret it as "wrapped up
    like a douche". The original Springsteen lyric is neither of
    the above, instead being "cut loose like a deuce". Springsteen
    once attributed the popularity of the Manfred Mann version
    partially to Thompson's enunciation. Also, the song features
    the "Celebrated Chop Waltz", or 
    <i>Chopsticks</i>, approximately two-thirds into the album
    version.</p>
      <p>In 2002, Danish act Funkstar Deluxe released its disco
    version of this song.</p>
      <p>Then, in 2007 (April 6), several remixes were released by
    the German DJ Michael Mind as 
    <i>Michael Mind featuring Manfred Mannâ€™s Earth Band</i>, adding
    electronic beats to the major hit of 1977 and rising to number
    12 of the German charts.</p>
      <p>A ska version can be found on Springsteen's album, recorded
    with the Sessions Band.</p>
      <p>Lil' Wayne sampled this song on his song "Blinded" from a
    mixtape released by The Empire Entitled 
    <i>The Drought Is Over (The Reincarnation)</i>.</p>
