      <p>"Broken Wings" is a #1 hit song released as a 1985 single by
    the band Mr. Mister.</p>
      <p>The band's first single from their 1985 
    <i>Welcome to the Real World</i>album, "Broken Wings" reached
    the number one position on the U.S. charts in December 1985,
    where it remained for two weeks. It was released as the band
    was just about to embark on a U.S. tour opening for Tina
    Turner. The song reached number four in the UK Singles Chart,
    the highest the group ever achieved in that country. Broken
    Wings also ranked #32 on VH1's list of the most awesomely bad
    songs of all-time.</p>
      <p>The song was co-written with lyricist John Lang, who was
    inspired by a book called "Broken Wings" written by Khalil
    Gibran . The lyrics "Take these broken wings and learn to fly
    again" may be a reference to The Beatles' song "Blackbird." The
    song is a mix of synth, digitally delayed guitar, bass and
    drums. The song's hissing intro was an effect created by the
    sound of crash cymbal played in reverse . There is a distinct
    guitar sound in this track thanks to Steve Farris' innovation
    of the electric guitar, managing to extract a delay effect at
    an odd timing to create a contrast to the steadiness of the
    bass and beat. The outro to the song features Page singing very
    high and lengthy falsetto notes.</p>
      <p>The music video for "Broken Wings" was directed by Oley
    Sassone and filmed in black &amp; white. It features lead
    vocalist Richard Page driving through the desert in a classic
    old convertible. There is a scene of striking imagery where
    Page is sitting in a church when an eagle flies in through the
    window and lands next to him on the pew and they exchange a
    gaze. The full band is also featured in performance scenes
    during the video. Also appearing in the video are an unknown
    man and woman dancing Tango. They are only shown from the waist
    down and their faces are never seen.,</p>
