      <p>"The Wayward Wind" is a country song written by Stan
    Lebowsky and Herb Newman.</p>
      <p>In 1956 versions were recorded by Gogi Grant, Tex Ritter,
    and Jimmy Young, of which Grant's was the biggest seller in the
    United States and Ritter's in the United Kingdom. The song
    reached #1 on the Cash Box chart, which combined all recorded
    versions, but must have got most of that popularity from the
    Gogi Grant version, which reached #1 on the Billboard chart on
    its own. The song is one of only two songs that were major hits
    for Grant, the other being "Suddenly There's a Valley".</p>
      <p>In 1961 Gogi Grant's recording was reissued and reached
    Billboard #50 and Cash Box #78. That same year, Patsy Cline
    made a recording, which did not chart.</p>
      <p>In 1963 a new recording was made by Frank Ifield, which
    reached #1 on the UK charts.</p>
      <p>The song made the Billboard country chart in the 1980s in a
    version by Sylvia, with accompaniment by James Galway.</p>
