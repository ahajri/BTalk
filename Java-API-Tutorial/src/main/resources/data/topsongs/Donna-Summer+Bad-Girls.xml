      <p>"Bad Girls" is a critically acclaimed 1979 single released
    by American singer Donna Summer. Co-written by Summer and the
    Brooklyn Dreams. The inspiration for her to write the song came
    after one of her assistants was offended by a police officer
    who thought she was a street prostitute. A rough version of the
    song had originally been written a couple of years before its
    release. Neil Bogart, upon hearing it, wanted Donna to give it
    to Cher for her upcoming album. Donna refused and put it away
    for a couple of years.</p>
      <p>The song became a number-one hit on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>pop, R&amp;B and dance singles charts
    simultaneously becoming, alongside "Hot Stuff", her most
    successful single. The song helped the the album of the same
    name to reach the multi-platinum status in the United States. A
    12" single of the song was released as a medley with "Hot
    Stuff". Although "Hot Stuff" was extended for the 12" single,
    "Bad Girls" remained in the 4:55 album version. A "Bad Girls"
    12" single with a time of 6:55 was produced but never released
    commercially. A demo version of the song was released on the
    "Deluxe Edition" of the "Bad Girls" cd.</p>
