      <p>"Knock Three Times" is a popular song recorded by Tony
    Orlando and Dawn. It was released as a single in November 1970,
    paired with their other hit song, "Candida". The single hit
    number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in January 1971 and
    eventually sold nine million copies, also claiming the
    number-one spot on the UK Singles Chart. The composers of this
    song L.Russell Brown/Irwin Levine, were thinking of the song 
    <i>UP ON THE ROOF</i>and they wanted to write a song with that
    kind of lyrical flavor, tenement living. Knock Three Times
    actually sold more than 100 thousand records a day in New York
    City alone for ten straight days. The Motion picture NOW AND
    THEN also contains this song, as well as a half dozen other
    feature films..</p>
      <p>It was covered by Billy "Crash" Craddock in 1971 and peaked
    at number three country hit.</p>
      <p>, The song was sung by Vic Reeves on the Reeves &amp;
    Mortimer comedy panel show 
    <i>Shooting Stars</i>, during the "Impressions Round" where
    Reeves sings a popular song "in the style of a club
    singer".</p>
      <p>Dolly Parton performed the song on her 1976-1977 variety
    show 
    <i>Dolly!</i>
      </p>
      <p>Paul and Storm released a Larry Craig-themed parody of this
    song, entitled "Tap Three Times".</p>
      <p>A dance/club remake of "Knock Three Times" was released in
    July 2008 by "DJ Freddy Retro featuring Jim Davis Jr." on Casa
    Records.</p>
