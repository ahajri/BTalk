      <p>"Slow Jamz" is the Grammy-nominated first single from
    Twista's album 
    <i>Kamikaze</i>and from Kanye West's debut album 
    <i>The College Dropout</i>. Released in 2003, the single, which
    features Kanye West and Jamie Foxx peaked at number one in the
    USA for a week on February 10, 2004 becoming Twista's, West's
    and Foxx's first number one single. The Kanye West version
    includes an intro and two extra verses by Jamie Foxx, and
    excludes the original outro by Twista. The song was nominated
    for a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. 
    <i>Q</i>magazine listed it as the nineteenth greatest hip-hop
    song of all time.</p>
      <p>The song is a tribute to classic smooth soul artists and
    slow jam songs. Kanye West is the song's producer and supplies
    the first verse, Twista gives the second verse and the outro,
    and actor/singer Jamie Foxx sings the chorus. The song's hook –
    "Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well
    well well well" – is taken from Luther Vandross's version of "A
    House Is Not a Home."</p>
      <p>Twista's first verse is given a memorable introduction with
    innuendo from West and former 
    <i>Talk Soup</i>host Aisha Tyler:</p>
      <p>The song refers to the following soul artists
    (chronologically in the song):</p>
      <p>The music video has 2 versions. In the 1st version it has no
    text at all whereas in the 2nd version there has text showing
    what Jamie Foxx says during the hook and what Twista says
    during his verse. The video shows a party; at first we see
    Jamie Foxx buying records for the party then it goes to the
    party where Kanye West and Twista are. There are no storyline
    changes between the two versions. It includes cameo appearances
    by Common, John Legend, Mike Epps, and Aisha Tyler.</p>
