      <p>"If I Can't Have You" is a song written by Barry, Robin and
    Maurice Gibb of the Bee Gees.</p>
      <p>"If I Can't Have You" was intended to be included in the
    follow-up album to 
    <i>Children of the World</i>(1976), but was given to Yvonne
    Elliman when the Bee Gees became involved in the production of
    the movie 
    <i>Saturday Night Fever</i>(1977) whose soundtrack featured the
    song. The original intent was that the Bee Gees contribute "How
    Deep is Your Love" for Elliman to sing in 
    <i>Saturday Night Fever</i>but ultimately the Bee Gees recorded
    that song themselves while Elliman recorded "If I Can't Have
    You". Elliman's version became an international smash hit, and
    reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and #4 in the UK.
    The Bee Gees' version was released as the B-side to the single
    "Stayin' Alive" in 1978 and also appeared in the 2001
    compilation 
    <i>Bee Gees Their Greatest Hits: The Record</i>.</p>
      <p>A remixed version of The Bee Gees recording was released on
    the remastered version of Bee Gees Greatest in 2007 and marked
    the return of The Bee Gees to the US Hot Dance Tracks charts
    after 28 years.</p>
      <p>The song was covered in 1993 by British singer Kim Wilde and
    recorded as one of two new tracks on her compilation album 
    <i>The Singles Collection 1981-1993</i>.</p>
      <p>The single reached #12 in the UK, though was never released
    in the US. It became Wilde's biggest hit of the 1990s (with the
    possible exception of 1992's "Love Is Holy") and one of the
    biggest hits of her career in Australia, where it reached
    #3.</p>
      <p>It was released in several extended remixes on the 12" and
    CD-single formats. The B-side was an exclusive non-album track
    called "Never Felt So Alive".</p>
