      <p>"Don't Leave Me This Way" is an R&amp;B/soul/disco song
    written by Kenneth Gamble, Leon Huff, and Cary Gilbert. First
    charting as a hit for Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes, an
    act on Gamble &amp; Huff's Philadelphia International label in
    1975, "Don't Leave Me This Way" was later a hit single for both
    Thelma Houston and The Communards.</p>
      <p>The Blue Notes' original version of the song, featuring
    Teddy Pendergrass' lead vocal, was included as an album track
    on the group's successful 
    <i>Wake Up Everybody</i>LP. Though not issued as a single in
    the United States, the Blue Notes' recording reached #3 on the
    US Billboard Disco charts and later reached #5 on the UK
    singles chart.</p>
      <p>"Don't Leave Me This Way" was covered by Motown artist
    Thelma Houston in 1976. Her version, with its more overt disco
    arrangement, was a massive international hit, topping the soul
    singles chart. and US Billboard Hot 100 chart for one week in
    April 1977. The song peaked at #13 in the UK. The song went to
    number one on the disco chart, and is considered by many to be
    not just one of the greatest songs of the disco era but the
    entire 70's as well.</p>
      <p>Houston's version was revived in 1995 in a remix, which
    reached #19 on the US Billboard Dance Chart and #35 in the UK.
    This version got Houston ranked #86 on VH1's "100 Greatest
    One-hit Wonders", as well as the #2 spot on their "100 Greatest
    Dance Songs" list.</p>
      <p>Nine years later, the song was revived by The Communards in
    an avowedly Hi-NRG version. This recording topped the UK charts
    for four weeks in September 1986, becoming the biggest selling
    record of the year in the process. The featured guest vocalist
    was jazz singer Sarah Jane Morris. The song only reached #40 on
    the US Billboard Hot 100 but did top the Billboard Dance chart.
    .</p>
      <p>Several remixes were issued, notably the "Son of Gotham City
    Mix" which was split across two sides of a 12" single and ran
    for a total of 22 minutes 55 seconds.</p>
      <p>"Don't Leave Me This Way" has been recorded by several other
    artists including Isaac Hayes, Gerard Joling, José Galisteo,
    Andy Abraham, and The Temptations, amongst others. In 1984 the
    first covers before The Communards were by Carol Jiani and
    another one by a group named Slip; both were Hi-NRG styled
    covers. The song was also covered by pop diva Sheena Easton in
    2001 on her "Fabulous" disco album. It's been covered three
    times on 
    <i>American Idol</i>, by LaToya London, Vonzell Solomon, and
    Ramiele Malubay. A French version was sung by Sylvie Vartan
    under the title "
    <i>Ne pars pas comme ça</i>".</p>
      <p>Cher performed the song at her Las Vegas show Cher at the
    Colosseum as a prelude to "Take Me Home".</p>
