   <descr>
      <p>"Baby, Don't Get Hooked on Me" was a hit song by country and
    pop singer-songwriter Mac Davis. Coming from his breakthrough
    album of the same name, the song reached No. 1 on the Billboard
    Hot 100 in September 1972, spending three weeks atop that
    chart. He wrote the song when the record company demanded he
    write a tune with a "hook".</p>
      <p>The song was also a modest country hit concurrent with its
    pop success, reaching No. 26 shortly after the peak of its pop
    success.</p>
