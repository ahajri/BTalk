      <p>"Green Eyes" is a popular song, originally written in
    Spanish under the title "Aquellos Ojos Verdes" ("Those Green
    Eyes") by Adolfo Utrera and Nilo Men√©ndez. The English
    translation was made by Eddie Rivera and Eddie Woods in
    1929.</p>
      <p>The English version of the song was a hit for the Jimmy
    Dorsey orchestra. The recording was made on March 19, 1941 with
    vocals by Helen O'Connell and Bob Eberly and released by Decca
    Records as catalog number 3698. The flip side was "Maria
    Elena." The record first reached the 
    <i>Billboard</i>charts on May 9, 1941 and lasted 21 weeks on
    the chart, peaking at #1. Since "Maria Elena" was also a #1
    hit, this was a major double-sided hit recording.</p>
      <p>Gloria Jean sang the Spanish lyrics to "Aquellos Ojos
    Verdes" in the 1943 film, 
    <i>When Johnny Comes Marching Home</i>.</p>
      <p>Ben Affleck also sang the Spanish version, in the 2006 film,
    
    <i>Hollywoodland</i>, in pivotal scenes just prior to the fatal
    shooting of his character, George Reeves.</p>
      <p>R&amp;B group, the Ravens, had regional success with a 1955
    revival.</p>
      <p>Allan Sherman recorded a version titled "Green Stamps", a
    parody of S&amp;H Green Stamps. During the recording session
    (according to the liner notes on the album), Sherman had a talk
    with the college types who hadn't heard of "Green Eyes." He
    said it was, like the Bossa Nova, once a red-hot tune by Helen
    O'Connell. He asked, "Any of you remember red-hot Helen
    O'Connell?" (About half did.)</p>
      <p>The version written for English audiences varies from the
    Spanish. The Big Band version typically had a male voice
    singing these words, followed by a female voice singing the
    same words, with the exception of the last line. This is one
    version:</p>
      <p>(Male voice)</p>
      <p>(Female voice)</p>
