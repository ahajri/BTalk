      <p>"Miss You" is a 1978 hit song by The Rolling Stones, from
    their album 
    <i>Some Girls</i>.</p>
      <p>"Miss You" was written by singer Mick Jagger jamming with
    keyboardist Billy Preston during rehearsals for the March 1977
    El Mocambo club gigs (yielding Side Three of the 
    <i>Love You Live</i>album). Although guitarist Keith Richards
    is credited for co-writing, Jagger is generally regarded as the
    principal composer.</p>
      <p>Mick Jagger and Ron Wood insist that "Miss You" wasn't
    conceived as a disco song, while Keith Richards said "...Miss
    You was a damn good disco record, it was calculated to be one."
    In any case, what was going on in discos did make it to the
    recording. Charlie Watts said that "A lot of those songs like
    Miss You on Some Girls... were heavily influenced by going to
    the discos. You can hear it in a lot of those four-to-the-floor
    and the Philadelphia-style drumming." For the bass part Bill
    Wyman started from Billy Preston's bass guitar on the song
    demo.[1]. Chris Kimsey, who engineered the recording of the
    song, said Wyman went "...to quite a few clubs before he got
    that bass line sorted out.", which Kimsey said "made that
    song."[2] Jagger sang a good part of the chorus using falsetto
    "ooh"s often in unison with harmonica, guitar, and electric
    piano.</p>
      <p>Unlike most of 
    <i>Some Girls</i>, "Miss You" features several studio
    musicians. In addition to Sugar Blue, who according to Ron Wood
    was found while busking on the streets of Paris, Ian McLagan
    played understated Wurlitzer electric piano, and Mel Collins
    provides the saxophone solo for the instrumental break.</p>
      <p>The 12 inch version of the song runs over 8 minutes and
    features additional instrumentation and solos, particularly on
    guitar. This song, the first edit the Rolling Stones did for a
    12 inch single, also contains an additional set of lyrics in
    the second verse, after the line "Hey, let's go mess and fool
    around you know, like we used to".</p>
      <p>"Miss You" became The Rolling Stones' eighth number-one hit
    in the U.S. on its initial release in 1978. It reached number
    three in the UK. The song was originally nearly nine minutes
    long, but was edited to four-and-a-half minutes for the album
    version, and to three-and-a-half minutes for the radio single,
    although an eight-and-a-half minutes long "Special Disco
    Version" was also released on 12-inch single - featuring the
    track at its longest and most complete. The B-side of the
    single was another album track, "Far Away Eyes", a
    tongue-in-cheek country and western tune sung by Jagger in a
    pronounced drawl.</p>
      <p>A live recording was captured during the Rolling Stones'
    1989-1990 Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour and released on the
    1991 live album 
    <i>Flashpoint</i>. Justin Timberlake collaborated with The
    Rolling Stones for a live performance of "Miss You" at the
    Toronto Rocks festival. Jagger inserted the chorus of
    Timberlake's hit "Cry Me a River" during the song's
    breakdown.</p>
      <p>In 2004, 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>magazine rated "Miss You" number 496 in its
    list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.</p>
      <p>Sugar Blue re-recorded the song on his 1993-album 
    <i>Blue Blazes</i>. Etta James, in her "
    <i>Matriarch of the Blues</i>" 2000 album, covered 
    <i>Miss You</i>., It was covered by neo-soul singer Musiq
    Soulchild for his 2003 album 
    <i>Soulstar</i>. In this version, the reference to "Puerto
    Rican girls" is replaced with "pretty girls"., It was covered
    in an instrumental jazz version by E Street Band member Danny
    Federici for his 2006 album 
    <i>Out Of A Dream</i>. It was released as the first and only
    single from the album., Joseph Arthur covered the song during
    his performance at the San Diego House of Blues on October 19,
    2006., American band Black Eyed Peas made a cover of this song
    in Fashion Rocks 2008., Japanese singer-songwriter UA
    collaborated with the band Little Creatures for her 2005 album 
    <i>Nephew</i>and covered "Miss You" in a downbeat, experimental
    style., "The Dynamics", a British band, released a reggae
    version in 2008., The song is also covered by the Swedish band
    The Concretes.</p>
      <p>"Miss You" was used in the opening scene of the pilot
    episode of 
    <i>Miami Vice</i>, which first aired on September 16, 1984. The
    song was used in the 1986 Sean Penn crime drama, 
    <i>At Close Range</i>. It was remixed by west coast hip-hop
    producer Dr. Dre for the soundtrack to 
    <i>Austin Powers in Goldmember</i>., The song was featured in a
    viral video skit known as "Jagg Off" where two men have to
    compete by doing "their best Jagger" as in imitating his
    on-stage dancing to the tune of this song.</p>
