      <p>"With Arms Wide Open" is a song composed by the band Creed,
    featured on the album 
    <i>Human Clay</i>. Scott Stapp wrote the lyrics when he found
    out that he was going to be a father. His son would be named
    Jagger. "With Arms Wide Open" topped the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for four weeks
    in July 2000; a month later it reached the U.S. Top 40. In
    September, it was announced that Creed would release a limited
    edition single of "With Arms Wide Open" with some profits
    benefiting Scott Stapp's With Arms Wide Open Foundation to
    "promote healthy, loving relationships between children and
    their families". In October, the song hit the top ten and
    topped Billboard's Adult Top 40 chart for eight weeks. It hit
    number one on the Hot 100 on the issue dated November 11 for
    one week, and the video topped VH1's top ten tracks of 2000. In
    February 2001, Scott Stapp and Mark Tremonti won a Grammy Award
    for Best Rock Song. The song was also nominated for Best Rock
    Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group, but lost to U2 for
    Beautiful Day.</p>

    <i>25 Greatest Power Ballads</i>.</p>
