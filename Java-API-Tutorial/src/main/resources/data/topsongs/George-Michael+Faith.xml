      <p>"Faith" was a #1 song, written and performed by George
    Michael, released as a single on Columbia Records, from his
    1987 album. According to magazine, it was the top-selling
    single of the year in the United States in 1988.</p>
      <p>7": UK / Epic EMU 2</p>
      <p>12": UK / Epic EMU T2</p>
      <p>U.S. CD single</p>
      <p>Having disbanded Wham! the previous year, there was a keen
    expectation for Michael's solo career and "Faith" would go on
    to become one of his most popular and enduring songs, as well
    as being the most simplistic in its production. It was the
    second of six singles released from the well-received
    album.</p>
      <p>A famous video was made, which provided some definitive
    images of the 1980s music industry in the process - Michael in
    shades, designer stubble, a leather jacket &amp; a particularly
    memorable pair of tight Levi's blue jeans &amp; cowboy boots,
    playing a guitar near a classic-design jukebox.</p>
      <p>The video for "Freedom! '90", released three years later,
    used some of the elements used in the "Faith" video, from the
    guitar, jeans, jacket all the way to the jukebox.</p>
      <p>The song reached number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100
    singles chart and number two on the UK Singles Chart.</p>
      <p>On the Hot 100 chart, "Faith" rocketed from #54 to #37, the
    week of October 31, 1987, reaching #1 on December 12, 1987 and
    remaining there for 4consecutive weeks, easily becoming the
    longest running chart topper of 1987. Altogether, "Faith"
    lingered in the Top 10 for 9 weeks, the Top 20 for 11 weeks
    &amp; the Top 40 for 15 weeks.</p>
      <p>"Faith" was covered by the Nu metal/Rapcore band Limp Bizkit
    on their 1997 album 
    <i>Three Dollar Bill, Yall$</i>. The video (released November
    20, 1998) shows scenes of Limp Bizkit by their tour bus at the
    Family Values Tour 1998. It features Fred Durst and Wes Borland
    dressed up as their alter egos 'The Weapon' and 'The
    Liquidator' at the beginning, with Borland explaining that he
    "...hates Limp Bizkit.". Jonathan Davis Fieldy and Brian "Head"
    Welch from Korn also make an appearance.</p>
      <p>The song is followed by a hidden track, "Blind", which is
    1:25 long (not to be confused by Korn's song, also named
    "Blind").</p>
      <p>This version of "Faith" is featured in the promo of the 2008
    film 
    <i>Religulous</i>.</p>
