      <p>"True Colors" is a song written by songwriters Billy
    Steinberg and Tom Kelly. It was both the title track and the
    first single released from Cyndi Lauper's second album. It was
    the only original song on the album that Lauper did not help
    write.</p>
      <p>Billy Steinberg originally wrote True Colors about his own
    mother. Tom Kelly altered the first verse and the duo submitted
    the song to Cyndi Lauper. Their demo was in a form of piano
    based gospel ballad like "Bridge over Troubled Water".
    Steinberg told Songfacts that "Cyndi completely dismantled that
    sort of traditional arrangement and came up with something that
    was breathtaking and stark." Other songs they wrote for Cyndi
    Lauper include "I Drove All Night" and "Unconditional Love",
    the former of which went on to be covered by Celine Dion, the
    latter of which went on to be covered by Susanna Hoffs.</p>
      <p>It reached #1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, #3 in
    Australia, and #12 on the UK Singles Chart.</p>
      <p>"True Colors" also became a legend of its own in the gay
    community. Lauper embarked on a True Colors Tour in 2007 with
    several other acts including Deborah Harry and Erasure. The
    tour was for the Human Rights Campaign to promote human rights
    in the US and beyond. A second True Colors tour occurred in
    2008.</p>
      <p>In 1998, the song was covered by Phil Collins for his
    compilation album 
    <i>...Hits</i>. The version was a smooth-jazz-influenced
    version compared to the original. R&amp;B singer Babyface
    provided backing vocals.</p>
      <p>The track peaked at #2 on the U.S. 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart and at #26
    on the UK Singles Chart.</p>
