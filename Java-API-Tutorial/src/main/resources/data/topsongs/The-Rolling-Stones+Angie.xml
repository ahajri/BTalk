      <p>"Angie" is a song by rock and roll band The Rolling Stones,
    featured on their 1973 album 
    <i>Goats Head Soup</i>.</p>
      <p>Recorded in November and December 1972, "Angie" was written
    primarily by Keith Richards. The song is an acoustic guitar
    driven ballad which tells of the end of a romance. The song is
    noted for its poignant lyrics concerning lost love and the
    grieving involved. Rolling Stones-recording regular Nicky
    Hopkins plays the song's distinctive piano chords. The strings
    on the piece (as well as "Winter") were arranged by Nicky
    Harrison. One unusual feature of the original recording is that
    singer Mick Jagger's vocal guide track (made before the final
    vocals were performed) is faintly audible throughout the song
    (an effect sometimes called a "ghost vocal").</p>
      <p>Released as a single in August 1973, "Angie" went straight
    to the top of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and reached number
    five on the UK singles chart.</p>
      <p>Questions about the song's origins have never ceased.
    Despite wide-ranging rumors that "Angie" was written by Jagger
    about a relationship he had with David Bowie's wife Angela,
    Jagger denies this. Richards claims to have come up with the
    title and chord sequence a year before production on the album
    began. In the liner notes to the compilation disc 
    <i>Jump Back</i>, Richards says, "I'd recently had my daughter
    born, whose name was Angela, and the name was starting to ring
    around the house. 'Angie' just fitted."</p>
      <p>The Rolling Stones have frequently performed the song in
    concert; it was included in set lists on their 1973, 1975 and
    1976 tours, and on every tour since their 1982 European tour.
    Concert renditions have been released on the albums 
    <i>Stripped</i>and 
    <i>Live Licks</i>. Two music videos were shot to promote the
    song.</p>
      <p>In 2005 the German party CDU used the song for its election
    campaign for Angela Merkel; the Rolling Stones had not given
    Merkel permission to use the song.</p>
