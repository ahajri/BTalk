      <p>"Family Affair" is a 2001 hit song for Mary J. Blige,
    produced by Dr. Dre. It was taken from her fifth album, 
    <i>No More Drama</i>, and was responsible for popularizing the
    terms "hateration" and "dancery" in the US, as well as
    contributing to the popularity of the word "crunk".</p>
      <p>The music for "Family Affair" was originally created in a
    jam session between Dr. Dre and musicians Mel-Man, Camara
    Kambon and Mike Elizondo. Later, Blige heard the song and she
    and her brother Bruce Miller contributed the lyrics and melody.
    Finally, Dr. Dre produced Blige's vocals, but this was done at
    a distance because at the time he was busy filming the movie 
    <i>Training Day</i>. The music video was directed by Dave
    Meyers.</p>
      <p>The single topped the Hot 100 for six weeks from November 3,
    2001. It was Blige's first Hot 100 number-one, although she had
    previously reached number two with "Not Gon' Cry" in 1996.</p>
      <p>In 2007, this song was used on a Propel Fitness Water
    commercial. According to Rolling Stone's Magazine Dr.Dre earned
    2 million dollars in royalties from the mega-hit.</p>
      <p>In 2008, for 
    <i>Billboard</i>magazine's 50th Anniversary, "Family Affair"
    was listed as the 79th best single on the The Billboard Hot 100
    All-Time Top Songs. while at the end of 2009 was named the 12th
    most successful song from 2000 to 2009, on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot 100 Songs of the Decade. 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>ranked it number ninety-five on their list
    of 100 Best Songs of the 2000s decade.</p>
