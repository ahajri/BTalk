   <descr>
      <p>"Doesn't Really Matter" is a song recorded by American
    R&amp;B-pop singer Janet Jackson for the soundtrack to the 2000
    film 
    <i>Nutty Professor II: The Klumps</i>. Released as a single in
    July 2000, the track later appeared on Jackson's seventh studio
    album, 
    <i>All for You</i>(2001).</p>
      <p>The song was the lead single from the Universal Pictures
    film 
    <i>Nutty Professor II: The Klumps</i>, in which Jackson
    co-starred with actor Eddie Murphy. It became Jackson's ninth
    number one on the Hot 100 and first in the 2000s, staying atop
    for three weeks, and also making Jackson the first artist in
    history to score number-one singles in the '80s, '90s, and
    '00s. An alternate mix of the song was later included on
    Jackson's seventh studio album, 2001's 
    <i>All for You</i>. Jackson performed this version at the 2000
    MTV Video Music Awards. The song was used in the dance video
    game 
    <i>Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova</i>, and was covered in
    Japanese by Hitomi Shimatani and re-titled "Papillon"
    (Jackson's character's name). Jackson performed the song on her
    All for You Tour and Rock Witchu Tour.</p>
      <p>The music video, directed by Joseph Kahn, shows Jackson in
    an abstract anime-based, futuristic Japan, featuring an AIBO
    dog, morphing clothes, levitating platforms, and a futuristic
    Acura vehicle. Also, behind her and her dancers screens show
    various scenes from the Dreamcast games 
    <i>Jet Grind Radio</i>and 
    <i>Shenmue</i>. It was featured on MTV's 
    <i>Making the Video</i>on June 28, 2000. The video was only
    available on the enhanced CD single, and on the 
    <i>Nutty Professor II</i>DVD as part of an extra feature. It
    was not released on any of Jackson's video compilations. Janet
    Jackson discovered the lyrics in a notebook she found lying
    around. She thought it would go well with the movie. She didn't
    change anything about the song except the beat. The lyrics
    stayed the same. The music video was featured on a VHS release
    on 
    <i>Nutty Professor II: The Klumps</i>.</p>
