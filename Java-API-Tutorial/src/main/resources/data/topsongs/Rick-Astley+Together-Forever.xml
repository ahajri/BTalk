      <p>"Together Forever" is a song recorded by Rick Astley, which
    ascended to number one on the Hot 100 on June 18, 1988. It was
    Astley's second and final U.S. chart-topper. It reached number
    2 in Britain, being denied the top spot by 
    <i>Neighbours</i>star Kylie Minogue with her debut single 
    <i>I Should Be So Lucky</i>. It uses a similar chord structure
    and melody to "Never Gonna Give You Up" (as with most songs
    produced by Stock Aitken Waterman at the time), but different
    lyrics.</p>
