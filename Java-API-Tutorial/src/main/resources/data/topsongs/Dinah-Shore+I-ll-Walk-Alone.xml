      <p>"I'll Walk Alone" is a 1944 popular song with music by Jule
    Styne and lyrics by Sammy Cahn. The song, like others that came
    out during the World War II years such as "Till Then," reflects
    the enforced separation of couples caused by the war. While
    "Till Then" is written from the point of view of the soldier
    wanting his lover to wait for him, "I'll Walk Alone" is written
    from the point of view of the stay-at-home lover, promising to
    be true.</p>
      <p>Dinah Shore made the best-known version of this song,
    introducing it in the Universal Studios film "Follow the Boys"
    and taking it to the top of the charts (her first #1 hit) for
    four weeks in 1944, and in fact recorded the song in the early
    1960s as well. Martha Tilton also fared well, placing the song
    in Billboard's Top Ten. Oddly, when the song was revived in the
    1950s, it was often done by male singers, with a very popular
    version being done by Don Cornell (1952 top ten).</p>
      <p>Oddly, teen idol Ricky Nelson recorded a version for his
    1958 album Ricky Nelson</p>
      <p>For the film, 
    <i>Flags of Our Fathers</i>, director Clint Eastwood sings his
    version of the song on the soundtrack.</p>
