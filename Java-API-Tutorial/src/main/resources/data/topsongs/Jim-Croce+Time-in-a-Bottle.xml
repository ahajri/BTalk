      <p>"Time in a Bottle" was a posthumous number-one hit for
    singer-songwriter Jim Croce, reaching the top of the charts in
    December 1973, three months after his death in a plane
    crash.</p>
      <p>The song was originally written for Croce's son, A.J., and
    appeared on his first album in 1972, 
    <i>You Don't Mess Around with Jim</i>. The following year Croce
    would shoot to fame with his hit single "Bad Bad Leroy Brown",
    just months before the September 20 plane crash. 
    <i>Time in a Bottle</i>was later used as the title for a
    compilation album of Croce's love songs.</p>
      <p>The song started receiving widespread airplay in the fall of
    1973, after it was featured in an ABC TV movie, 
    <i>She Lives!</i>, starring Desi Arnaz Jr. and Season
    Hubley.</p>
