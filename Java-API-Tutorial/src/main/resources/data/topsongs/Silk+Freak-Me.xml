      <p>"Freak Me" is a R&amp;B ballad recorded by Atlanta,
    Georgia-based vocal quintet Silk in 1992. It was co-written and
    co-produced by Keith Sweat, for whom Silk was a touring opening
    act. Sweat also performed this on his 2003 
    <i>Live Album</i>.</p>
      <p>The song was released as the second single from Silk's album
    
    <i>Lose Control</i>. Their first single, "Happy Days", stalled
    at number eighty-six, but "Freak Me" became their first (and to
    date, only) number-one song on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. It
    also topped the U.S. Hot R&amp;B Singles chart.</p>
      <p>The song was covered by British boy band Another Level in
    1998. This version reached number one on the UK Singles Chart,
    overtaking Billie's 
    <i>Because We Want To</i>. Another Level's version was the 17th
    biggest selling boyband single of the 1990s in the UK selling
    415,000 copies.</p>
