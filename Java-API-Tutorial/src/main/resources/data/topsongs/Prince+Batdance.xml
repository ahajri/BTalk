      <p>"Batdance" is a song by Prince, from the 1989 soundtrack.
    Helped by the film's popularity, the song reached number one in
    the U.S., becoming Prince's fourth number-one single, and first
    since 1986's "Kiss".</p>
      <p>"Batdance" was a last-minute replacement for a brooding
    track titled "Dance with the Devil", which Prince felt was too
    dark. Incidentally, though "Dance with the Devil" remains
    unreleased, some of the lyrics appear on the album's liner
    notes.</p>
      <p>"Batdance" is almost two songs in one—a chaotic, mechanical
    dance beat that changes gears into a slinky, funky groove
    before changing back for the song's conclusion. The track is an
    amalgam of many musical ideas floating around at the time.
    Elements from at least seven songs (some unreleased) were
    incorporated into "Batdance": "200 Balloons", "We Got the
    Power", "House in Order", "Rave Unto the Joy Fantastic" (later
    released on the album, 
    <i>Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic</i>), "The Future", and "Electric
    Chair", as well as the 1966 "Batman Theme" by Neal Hefti. Some
    of these were mere snippets, and other segments showed up only
    in remixes of the track. The song was also loaded with dialog
    samples from the film.</p>
      <p>The song's music video, directed by Albert Magnoli and
    choreographed by Barry Lather, featured dancers costumed as
    multiple Batmen, Jokers and Vicki Vales. Prince appears both as
    himself, and as well as a costumed character in face paint
    known as "Gemini", with one side representing the Joker (evil),
    and the other, Batman (good). The Batmen and Jokers alternate
    dance sections, while Prince/Gemini sing the lyrics. Eventually
    the video ends with Gemini hitting a detonator, exploding an
    electric chair (referenced in the song), and Prince warning,
    "Stop" as the video abruptly ends. The video also features one
    Vicki Vale wearing a shirt with the words "All this and brains
    too", a reference to 
    <i>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</i>by Frank Miller, in which
    a female news presenter wears a top with the same slogan.</p>
      <p>Gemini is Prince's astrological sign, and is a reference to
    the duality throughout his music. "Gemini" would also make an
    appearance in the "Partyman" video, but with the "Batman" half
    replaced by Prince's normal appearance.</p>
      <p>The B-side to the "Batdance" is "200 Balloons", which was
    recorded for the film and serves as the musical blueprint for
    the main portion of "Batdance". The song was rejected for the
    film by Tim Burton and replaced with "Trust". However, the
    lyrics of "200 Balloons", as well as its namesake, reference
    the scene which it was created for, while the replacement track
    does not. Prince did little more than replace the lyrics of
    "200 Balloons" in its transition into "Batdance". Some lyrics
    even survived the transition, and more showed up in "The
    Batmix". "200 Balloons" also contains samples of "Rave Unto the
    Joy Fantastic", another song submitted for inclusion in the
    movie, but rejected (it was replaced by "Partyman").</p>
      <p>The 12" vinyl and CD Maxi versions of the single included
    two remixes of "Batdance" that were done by Mark Moore and
    William Orbit, "The Batmix" and "Vicki Vale Mix". "The Batmix"
    focuses on the chaotic "rock" section of "Batdance", and is
    supplemented with electronic distortion and sampling of voices,
    instruments, and larger excepts of Prince's then-unreleased
    "Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic". The "Vicki Vale Mix" is an
    extension of the middle part of "Batdance", which includes
    dialog between Bruce Wayne and Vicki. In addition to "200
    Balloons", the CD Maxi single (9-21257-2) features both of
    these remixes.</p>
