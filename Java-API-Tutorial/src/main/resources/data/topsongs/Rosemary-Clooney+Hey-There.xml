      <p>"Hey There" is a show tune from the musical play 
    <i>The Pajama Game,</i>written by Richard Adler and Jerry Ross.
    It was published in 1954.</p>
      <p>It was subsequently recorded by a number of artists. The
    recording by Rosemary Clooney reached #1 on Billboard's chart
    in 1954. Another version was also recorded about the same time
    by Sammy Davis, Jr., reaching #16 on Billboard's retail chart.
    The song (counting all recorded versions) also reached #1 on
    the Cash Box chart in 1954.</p>
      <p>In the context of the show, Sid sings it to a recording
    device, telling himself that he's foolish to continue his
    advances to Babe. He plays the tape back, and after responding
    to his own comments, sings a duet with himself.</p>
