      <p>"Honky Tonk Women" is a 1969 hit song by The Rolling Stones.
    Released as a single on 4 July 1969 in the UK and a week later
    in the US, it topped the charts in both nations.</p>
      <p>The song was written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards while
    on holiday in Brazil from late December 1968 to early January
    1969. Inspired by Brazilian gauchos at the ranch where Jagger
    and Richards were staying in Matão, São Paulo, the song was
    originally conceived as an acoustic country song. Richards has
    said: "[It] was originally written as a real Hank
    Williams/Jimmie Rogers/1930s country song."</p>
      <p>Two versions of the song were recorded by the band: the
    familiar hit which appeared on the 45 single and their
    collection of late 1960s singles, 
    <i>Through the Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2);</i>and a
    honky-tonk version entitled "Country Honk" with slightly
    different lyrics, which appeared on 
    <i>Let it Bleed</i>. The concert rendition of the song featured
    on 
    <i>Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!</i>differs from both the hit version
    and the country version, with a markedly different guitar
    introduction and an entirely different second verse.</p>
      <p>Thematically, a "honky tonk woman" refers to a dancing girl
    in a western bar who may work as a prostitute; the setting for
    the narrative in the first verse of the blues version is
    Memphis, while "Country Honk" sets the first verse in
    Jackson.</p>
      <p>The band initially recorded the track called "Country Honk",
    in London in early February 1969. The song was transformed into
    the familiar electric, riff-based hit single "Honky Tonk Women"
    sometime in the spring of 1969, prior to Mick Taylor's joining
    the group. In an interview in the magazine 
    <i>Crawdaddy</i>, Richards credits Taylor for influencing the
    track: "... the song was originally written as a real Hank
    Williams/Jimmie Rodgers/1930s country song. And it got turned
    around to this 
    <i>other</i>thing by Mick Taylor, who got into a completely
    different feel, throwing it off the wall another way." However,
    in 1979 Taylor recalled it this way: "I definitely added
    something to Honky Tonk Women, but it was more or less complete
    by the time I arrived and did my overdubs."</p>
      <p>The song is distinctive as it opens not with a guitar riff,
    but with a beat played on a cowbell. The Rolling Stones'
    producer Jimmy Miller performed the cowbell for the
    recording.</p>
      <p>Ry Cooder has asserted that he originated the song's main
    guitar riff, and has accused the Rolling Stones of "ripping him
    off". Rolling Stones pianist Ian Stewart said of the track:
    "It's bloody ten times Keith you hear."</p>
      <p>The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks from 23
    August 1969. The single was released in the UK the day after
    the death of founding member Brian Jones. "You Can't Always Get
    What You Want" was the single's B-side. It was later released
    on the compilation album 
    <i>Through the Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2)</i>in
    September.</p>
      <p>Concert versions of "Honky Tonk Women" are included on the
    albums 
    <i>'Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!'</i>, 
    <i>Love You Live</i>and 
    <i>Live Licks</i>.</p>
      <p>Gram Parsons's version of the song, released on the 1976
    rarities compilation 
    <i>Sleepless Nights</i>, features a slightly different set of
    lyrics and an arrangement that combines elements of both Stones
    versions.</p>
      <p>"Honky Tonk Women" was ranked #116 on the list of s 500
    Greatest Songs of All Time in 2004.</p>
      <p>from the album 
    <i>Let It Bleed</i>
      </p>
      <p>"Country Honk" is a country version of "Honky Tonk Women",
    released five months after on the album 
    <i>Let it Bleed</i>. As noted above the country arrangement was
    the original concept of "Honky Tonk Women".</p>
      <p>According to some sources "Country Honk" was recorded at the
    Elektra recording studio in Los Angeles. Byron Berline played
    the fiddle on the track, and has said that Gram Parsons was
    responsible for him being chosen for the job (Berline had
    previously recorded with Parson's band). Producer Glyn Johns
    suggested that Berline should record his part on the sidewalk
    outside the studio to add ambience to the number. Sam Cutler,
    the Rolling Stones' tour manager, performed the car horn at the
    beginning of the track. Nanette Workman performs backing vocals
    on this version (although the album sleeve credits actress
    Nanette Newman). Other sources state that "Country Honk" was
    recorded at Olympic Studios right after "Honky Tonk Women,"
    with only Berline's fiddle part overdubbed at Elektra Studios;
    this might be supported by the existence of a bootleg recording
    that does not contain either the fiddle or Mick Taylor's slide
    guitar. Richards has repeatedly stated that "Country Honk" is
    how "Honky Tonk Women" was originally written.</p>
