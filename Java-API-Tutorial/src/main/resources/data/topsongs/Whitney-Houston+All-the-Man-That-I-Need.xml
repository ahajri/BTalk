      <p>"All the Man That I Need" is the second single from pop
    singer Whitney Houston's third album 
    <i>I'm Your Baby Tonight</i>.</p>
      <p>The song was written by Dean Pitchford and Michael Gore; a
    version was released by Linda Clifford a decade earlier.
    Houston's music video for this song was directed by Peter
    Israelson (the same director for her videos "Greatest Love of
    All" and "Where Do Broken Hearts Go.") Sister Sledge also had a
    minor R&amp;B hit with the song in 1982 peaking at number
    forty-five on the soul charts..</p>
      <p>Released in December 1990, "All the Man That I Need" entered
    the Billboard Hot 100 Singles Chart at number fifty-three.
    Within four weeks of its release, it ascended to the top of the
    charts, becaming Houston's ninth number one Hot 100 single. It
    held the summit for two weeks, from February 23 to March 8. It
    remained in the Top 40 for fifteen weeks. It also topped the
    Hot 100 Single Sales and Hot 100 Airplay charts, her first song
    to achieve this feat since "Where Do Broken Hearts Go" in 1988.
    Additionally, the single also reached number one for four weeks
    on the Adult Contemporary Chart, and for two weeks on the
    R&amp;B Chart. Also, the song was notable as being Houston's
    first release to top all the charts it was eligible on. It was
    ranked sixteen on the Billboard Hot 100 Year End Charts for
    1991.</p>
      <p>Internationally, the song was more moderately successful,
    except in the UK, where it reached #13. It reached twenty-eight
    in both France and Switzerland, and number thirty-seven in
    Germany.</p>
      <p>The single was also certified Gold by the RIAA.</p>
