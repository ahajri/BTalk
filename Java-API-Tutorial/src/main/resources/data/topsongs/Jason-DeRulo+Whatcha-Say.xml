      <p>"Whatcha Say" is the debut single by American recording
    artist Jason Derülo. It was produced by J. R. Rotem with
    additional production by German producer Fuego and heavily
    samples the song "Hide and Seek" by Imogen Heap. "Whatcha Say"
    topped the U.S. Hot 100 in the United States.</p>
      <p>Jason Derülo recorded a new French-English version with
    Fanny J, a singer from French Guiana. A new music video has
    also been released.</p>
      <p>"Whatcha Say" received mixed reviews. Glenn Gamboa of 
    <i>Newsday</i>wrote: "For fans of Imogen Heap's "Hide and
    Seek," the new Jason DeRulo single "Whatcha Say"—which
    liberally samples from the song and even uses Heap's chorus as
    his own chorus—may be hard to swallow. But DeRulo weaves easily
    in and out of Heap's parts and matches his AutoTuned vocals to
    hers pretty well to craft a catchy, if derivative, little
    number." Upon its November 2009 UK release, noted R&amp;B
    writer Pete Lewis of 'Blues &amp; Soul' described the single as
    "Blending pounding beats and Derulo's rich, soulful vocals with
    an instantly-infectious pop hook sampled from alternative/indie
    songstress Imogen Heap".</p>
      <p>The song was performed live by Derulo on Thanksgiving Day in
    Philadelphia for the 90th anniversary of the 6abc IKEA
    Thanksgiving Day Parade. The song was also featured on the
    popular teen show, 
    <i>Gossip Girl</i>, in the episode "Treasure of Serena Madre",
    which premiered on November 30, 2009.</p>
      <p>The music video was released as the free video of the week
    on iTunes on October 27, 2009. In the music video, Derülo is
    seen cuddling on the couch inside a home penetrated by sunny
    lights with his love interest, and later on during the video,
    he is outside her door, waiting impatiently for her to forgive
    him, and begging her to let him in. Which follows the lyrics in
    his song, "So let me in, give me another chance..." The music
    video premiered on Monday, November 16 on MTV's AMTV. A music
    video was also released for the acoustic version, with J.R.
    Rotem playing the piano.</p>
      <p>The "Whatcha Say EP" was released on October 23, 2009. It
    features various remixes of the song along with the original
    and acoustic version of the song.</p>
      <p>"Whatcha Say" debuted on the Hot 100 at fifty four in the
    issue dated August 29, 2009. It reached number one in the issue
    dated November 14, 2009. The song also reached the number-one
    spot on the Canadian Nielsen SoundScan Digital Songs chart.
    "Whatcha Say" entered and peaked on the UK Singles Chart on
    November 22, 2009 at #3.</p>
