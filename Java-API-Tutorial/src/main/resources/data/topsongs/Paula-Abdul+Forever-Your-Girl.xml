      <p>"Forever Your Girl" is a 1989 hit song by Paula Abdul, taken
    from the album of the same name. It was written and produced by
    Oliver Leiber.</p>
      <p>After the sudden massive success of "Straight Up", Virgin
    Records quickly released another single to satisfy the public's
    newfound interest in Paula Abdul. It became the second #1 from
    her debut album, which would eventually yield a record of four
    #1 singles.</p>
      <p>The song is about loyalty in a relationship. The female
    vocalist proclaims that, despite rumors that others may be
    interested in her, none of those matter because she will remain
    faithful to the man she loves; she will remain "forever his
    girl." The single version differs slightly from the album
    version, as it uses more of the background male vocal and
    denser instrumentation.</p>
      <p>The song was part of a medley Abdul sang at the 1989 MTV
    Music Video Awards.</p>
      <p>"Forever Your Girl" spent two weeks at the top of the
    Billboard Hot 100 in May 1989, and charted at #24 in the UK and
    #17 in Germany.</p>
      <p>The video was directed by David Fincher, and featured Abdul
    acting as a choreographer and director of a children's
    performance (a 7-year-old Trevor Wright, 8-year-old Elijah Wood
    and 10-year-old Nikki Cox were among them). The "Forever Your
    Girl" video spent two weeks at number one on MTV's video
    rotation and helped establish Abdul as a leading visual
    entertainer.</p>
      <p>The video also satirized Robert Palmer videos, having three
    little girls dressed like the three women who play backup
    guitars in his videos (black dresses, red lipstick, white
    makeup, and hair tied in buns).</p>
