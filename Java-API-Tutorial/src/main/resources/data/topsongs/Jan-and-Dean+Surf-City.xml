      <p>"Surf City" is a surf song which, as recorded by Jan and
    Dean, was a #1 hit record in July 1963 for two weeks.</p>
      <p>The first draft of the song, with the working title "Goody
    Connie Won't You Come Back Home", was written by Brian Wilson
    of The Beach Boys. He gave it to Jan Berry and Dean Torrence of
    Jan and Dean who finished writing and recording it with Wilson
    in the early 1960s. Although Torrence contributed several
    important phrases to the song and kept the original lyrics,
    which were scanned and appear on the official Jan and Dean
    website, Torrence never insisted that his name should be
    recognized on the label as one of the authors of the song and
    his contribution is often overlooked.</p>
      <p>"Surf City" became the first surf song to reach number one
    on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in 1963. The song also crossed to
    #3 on Billboard's R&amp;B charts. In 1991, after moving to the
    city of Huntington Beach, California, Torrence went on to help
    convince elected officials that his new home town should be
    officially nicknamed "Surf City". The name was embraced and,
    and as of 2009, more than 65 businesses in the city include
    "Surf City" as part of their name.</p>
      <p>Torrence was also part of the team that developed the Surf
    City USA brand championed by the Huntington Beach Conference
    and Visitors Bureau.</p>
      <p>The Ramones covered "Surf City" on their album 
    <i>Acid Eaters</i>. The Go-Go's sang a cover version at 
    <i>An All-Star Tribute to Brian Wilson</i>(2001). They
    substituted the lyrics "Two girls for every boy" with "Two boys
    for every girl". The Meteors sang a cover version as well.</p>
