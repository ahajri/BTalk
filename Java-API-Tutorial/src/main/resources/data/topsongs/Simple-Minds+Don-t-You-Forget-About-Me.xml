      <p>"Don't You (Forget About Me)" is a song written for the
    soundtrack to the film 
    <i>The Breakfast Club</i>and performed by the band Simple Minds
    in 1985. The songwriters were producer Keith Forsey (who won an
    Oscar for "Flashdance... What a Feeling") and Steve Schiff
    (guitarist and songwriter from the Nina Hagen band).</p>
      <p>Forsey asked both Bryan Ferry and Billy Idol to record the
    song, but both declined; Idol would later perform a cover of it
    on his 2001 greatest hits compilation. Schiff then suggested
    Forsey ask the Scottish New Wave band Simple Minds, who
    initially refused as well, but then agreed under the
    encouragement of their label, A&amp;M. According to one
    account, the band "rearranged and recorded 'Don’t You (Forget
    About Me)' in three hours in a north London studio and promptly
    forgot about it."</p>
      <p>The track would become their most famous song and is
    considered a defining song of the 1980s. Continuing the rock
    direction recently taken on 
    <i>Sparkle in the Rain</i>but also glancing back at their
    melodic synthpop past, it caught the band at their commercial
    peak and, propelled by the success of 
    <i>The Breakfast Club</i>, became a number-one hit in the U.S.
    and around the world. It is the band's only number-one hit on
    the U.S. Top Rock Tracks chart, staying atop for three weeks.
    While only reaching number seven in the UK, it stayed on the
    charts from 1985–1987, one of the longest time spans for any
    single in the history of the chart.</p>
      <p>Despite its success, the band continued to dismiss the song,
    the most obvious slight being its absence from their subsequent
    album 
    <i>Once Upon a Time</i>. It finally appeared on the 1992
    best-of 
    <i>Glittering Prize 81/92</i>.</p>
      <p>Two versions were created for release; the edited version of
    4:32 appeared on the 45RPM single and the original motion
    picture soundtrack album of The Breakfast Club. However, the
    full &amp; uncut version was released on a 12" Single, which
    topped out at a total time length of 6:32. Most radio formats
    in the U.S. only programmed the 4:32 version, making it a
    rarity to hear the full version on radio. The compilation label
    UTV Records...a Universal Company...included the full version
    on their 2001 "Pure 80's Hits" Various Artists release. Unlike
    other "rare" long or 12" versions that just add "loops" &amp;
    "repeats" to expand it's programming, this version contains
    extra lyrics, bridges &amp; drum-licks that are clearly not
    included on the popular edited version.</p>
      <p>The music video, directed by Daniel Kleinman, takes place on
    a dancing floor in a dark room with a chandelier, a rocking
    horse and Sony televisions, whose screens are displaying scenes
    from 
    <i>The Breakfast Club</i>. Jim Kerr, the band's lead singer,
    dances in many scenes.</p>
      <p>The song has been covered by numerous artists including:</p>
      <p>Aside from its initial appearance in 
    <i>The Breakfast Club</i>, the song has been featured in
    various media throughout the years.</p>
