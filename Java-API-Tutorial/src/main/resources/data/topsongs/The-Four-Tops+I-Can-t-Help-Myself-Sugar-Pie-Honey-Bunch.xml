      <p>"I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)" is a 1965 hit
    song recorded by the Four Tops for the Motown label.</p>
      <p>Written and produced by Motown's main production team
    Holland-Dozier-Holland, the song is one of the most well-known
    Motown tunes of the 1960s. The song hit number one on the
    R&amp;B charts and was also the number-one song on the Hot 100
    for two non-consecutive weeks,. from June 12 to June 19 and
    from June 26 to July 3 in 1965. It replaced "Back in My Arms
    Again" by labelmates The Supremes, was first replaced by "Mr.
    Tambourine Man" by The Byrds, then regained the top spot before
    being replaced by "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" by The
    Rolling Stones.</p>
      <p>The song finds lead singer Levi Stubbs, assisted by the
    other three Tops and The Andantes, pleadingly professing his
    love to a woman: "Sugar pie, honey bunch/I'm weaker than a man
    should be!/Can't help myself/I'm a fool in love, you see." Like
    most of his lead parts, Stubbs' vocals are recorded in a tone
    that straddles the line between singing and shouting, similar
    to the tone of a black Baptist preacher. The melodic and
    chordal progressions are very similar to the Supremes' "Where
    Did Our Love Go".</p>
      <p>
         <i>Rolling Stone</i>magazine ranked the song #415 on their list
    of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It has been covered
    extensively since 1965, including versions done for several
    television commercials.</p>
      <p>In 1980, Bonnie Pointer had a crossover hit, with the song,
    peaking at #40 on the pop singles chart, #42 on the soul
    singles chart,. and #4 on the dance charts..</p>
      <p>In Autumn 1985, The Johnny Dyson Experience performed the
    song as their cover of a 9 Below Zero version, at the Crown
    public house in Bognor Regis, West Sussex, UK. The featured
    leadn instrument was harmonica played by David Turner who went
    on to join UK Ska legends Bad Manners.</p>
      <p>La Toya Jackson covered "I Can't Help Myself" on her 1995
    album 
    <i>Stop in the Name of Love</i>. The single was only released
    throughout Switzerland, Austria, Germany and Holland, with the
    album track "Baby Love" (cover of The Supremes' "Baby Love") as
    a B-side. The single failed to chart.</p>
      <p>Australian girl group, Teen Queens, released a version in
    1992 for their second single, where it peaked at #28 on the
    ARIA Singles Chart.</p>
      <p>The hard rock band Axe did a heavy version of the song on
    their first LP.</p>
      <p>During the 1980s the song (using the original Four Tops
    arrangement) was featured in a popular commercial for Kelloggs
    Honey Smacks cereal in the United Kingdom; sung by the cereal's
    (then) mascot, Barey Bee.</p>
      <p>During the late 1980s or early 1990s, the song was used in a
    Duncan Hines brownie mix commercial in the US.</p>
      <p>In 1980, the song was covered by Japanese pop singers Pink
    Lady on an episode of their American variety show 
    <i>Pink Lady and Jeff</i>.</p>
      <p>On Madonna's Who's That Girl Tour, she sang a few lines of
    "I Can't Help Myself" during the song "Like a Virgin."</p>
      <p>The band Say Anything also uses a few lines from the song on
    their track "Sure Baby...Hold Back" released on their first
    album entitled 
    <i>Baseball</i>.</p>
      <p>George Harrison's "This Song", which commented on the "My
    Sweet Lord"/"He's So Fine" plagiarism suit, borrowed the riff
    of "I Can't Help Myself". In the middle of the song, Harrison,
    referring to the Fontella Bass song, says, "Sounds like 'Rescue
    Me'". To which, Eric Idle replies, "Sounds like 'Sugar Pie,
    Honey Bunch' to me."</p>
      <p>Scottish Post-punk band Orange Juice makes reference to The
    Four Tops in their similarly named song "I Can't Help Myself"
    and made use of the intro bass riff in their instrumental song
    "Moscow".</p>
