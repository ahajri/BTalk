      <p>"Wild, Wild West" is a song by The Escape Club from their
    similarly named debut album, 
    <i>Wild Wild West</i>. The single hit the charts in late 1988
    eventually reaching #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 the week of
    November 12, 1988.</p>
      <p>The recording includes gunshots, as well as lyrics like "I
    love her eyes and her wild, wild hair", "heading for the 90s,
    living in the wild, wild west", and a section of phrases in
    Spanish. Critics at the time noted that portions of the song
    bore a strong similarity to Elvis Costello's "Pump It Up". The
    song is revered at singles dances and country line dancing
    circles as the music to which couples dance the Barn Dance
    singles mixer dance.</p>
      <p>The music video is famous for using mirror imaging to give
    the illusion of disembodied arms and legs.</p>
      <p>In 1989, Wally Wingert parodied it on the Dr. Demento radio
    show as "Adam West", a complaint about the casting of Michael
    Keaton as Batman.</p>
