      <p>"With a Little Luck" is Wings' #1 (U.S.) single from their
    1978 album 
    <i>London Town</i>. The song was written by Paul McCartney in
    Scotland and recorded on board the boat 
    <i>Fair Carol</i>in the Virgin Islands prior to the departure
    of lead guitarist Jimmy McCulloch and drummer Joe English from
    Wings. The song was released on St. Patrick's Day 1978, and hit
    number one in the United States later that spring. It was
    featured in the closing credits of the 1979 film 
    <i>Sunburn</i>starring Farrah Fawcett, Charles Grodin and Art
    Carney.</p>
      <p>"With a Little Luck" was also released on 
    <i>Wings Greatest</i>(1978) and the two-disc compilation, 
    <i>Wingspan</i>(2001). There were two versions of the song: the
    original 5:45 version on 
    <i>London Town</i>, and a DJ Edit, which only runs 3:13.</p>
      <p>This song was written by Paul during the time his wife,
    Linda McCartney, was expecting a child. Her pregnancy put Wings
    on hold for a while and this song is a tribute to this era in
    their lives. The single version was released in the United
    States because music radio was not willing to play a "non-disco
    rock song" longer than 4 minutes. "With a Little Luck" was cut
    down to 3:13, much to Paul McCartney's dismay.</p>
