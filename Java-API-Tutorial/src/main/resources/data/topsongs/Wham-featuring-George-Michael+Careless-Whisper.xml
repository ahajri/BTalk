      <p>"Careless Whisper" is a 1984 single by George Michael
    (credited to Wham! featuring George Michael in the USA),
    released by Epic Records in the UK, Japan, and other countries;
    and by Columbia Records in North America. The song was George
    Michael's first solo single although he was still performing in
    Wham! at the time (the song is included on Wham!'s album 
    <i>Make it Big</i>). The song features a prominent saxophone
    riff, and has been covered by a number of artists since its
    first release. It was released as a single and became a huge
    commercial success on both sides of the Atlantic. It reached
    number one in nearly 25 countries, selling about six million
    copies worldwide.</p>
      <p>Unlike all the Wham! singles (except "Wham Rap!"), it was
    co-written by Andrew Ridgeley, the other member of the duo. The
    two had written it together as unknowns three years earlier,
    when Michael was working as a cinema usher in Watford, England.
    In a June 2006 interview on London radio station Magic 105.4,
    Michael said that he wrote it "in his head" during work and
    that he recalls coming up with the saxophone riff whilst
    boarding a number 32 bus on the way home. Originally the riff
    had words, but Michael declined to state them, saying that they
    were very poor lyrics.</p>
      <p>The song went through at least two rounds of production. The
    first was during a trip Michael made to Muscle Shoals, Alabama,
    where he went to work with the legendary producer Jerry Wexler
    at the venerable Muscle Shoals Studio. Michael was unhappy with
    the version that was originally produced and decided to
    re-record and produce the song himself, this time coming up
    with the version that was finally released. The version Wexler
    produced did, however, see the light of day, but only later on,
    as a (4:41) B-side "Special Version" on 12", released in
    England.</p>
      <p>The officially released single, a mid-tempo ballad with
    soulful production and a remarkable saxophone solo by Steve
    Gregory, was issued in August 1984, entering the UK singles
    chart at number twelve. Within two weeks, it was at number one,
    ending a nine-week run at the top for "Two Tribes" by Frankie
    Goes to Hollywood. It stayed at number one for three weeks,
    going on to become the fifth best-selling single of 1984 in the
    United Kingdom; it was outsold only by the two Frankie Goes to
    Hollywood tracks "Two Tribes" and "Relax," Stevie Wonder with
    "I Just Called to Say I Love You" and Band Aid with "Do They
    Know It's Christmas." The song also topped the charts in 17
    other countries, including the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot 100 in the United States in February 1985
    under the credit "Wham! featuring George Michael"; spending
    three weeks at the top in America, the song was later named 
    <i>Billboard'</i>s number-one song of 1985.</p>
      <p>In a 2006 poll for a programme 
    <i>Britain's Favourite Break-up Songs</i>, "Careless Whisper"
    was voted sixth.</p>
      <p>The music video shows the guilt felt by a man over an
    affair, and his acknowledgement that his partner was always
    going to find out. It was taped on location in Miami during
    June 1984 and features such locales as Coconut Grove and Watson
    Island. However, it does not give credit to the young women
    (among others Lisa Stahl) who also starred in the video.</p>
      <p>"Careless Whisper" was generally the closing act for
    concerts on the 25 Live tour, and less often in the Faith Tour
    concerts, usually performed live in many concerts tours like
    the 
    <i>Cover To Cover Tour</i>and the 
    <i>Rock In Rio Tour</i>. George Michael would often perform
    "Careless Whisper" with an extended version of the ending,
    which is apparently his preferred version.</p>
      <p>The song has been covered by many other artists, including
    2Play (2005), Bananarama (2001) on 
    <i>Exotica</i>album, Brian McKnight (2007), Kenny G featuring
    McKnight (2004) for Kenny's At Last...The Duets Album, Boston
