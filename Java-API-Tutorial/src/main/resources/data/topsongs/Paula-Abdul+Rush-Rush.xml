      <p>"Rush Rush" is the first single released from Paula Abdul's
    second album, 
    <i>Spellbound</i>. Written by Peter Lord, and produced by Peter
    Lord and V. Jeffrey Smith (both members of The Family Stand),
    the song achieved success in the U.S. where it topped the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot 100.</p>
      <p>"Rush Rush" was a departure for Abdul stylistically, as it
    was her first ballad released as a single, following as it did
    the five uptempo singles from her debut LP, and was viewed by
    all observers as a rather risky strategy in kicking off her
    second album of new material 
    <i>Spellbound</i>. But the decision was vindicated, as it was
    very well received at retail.</p>
      <p>Abdul laid down a scratch vocal for the track, which was
    never intended to make it to the song's final mix. But the
    producers felt that its unpolished sound was what was needed to
    give the song its ingenuous tone, to match its subject matter
    and accompanying promotional video clip; it ended up on the
    final cut.</p>
      <p>The video features a street race and co-stars Keanu Reeves,
    drawing stylistic inspiration from the 1955 James Dean/Natalie
    Wood film 
    <i>Rebel Without A Cause</i>, and as such, has a period theme.
    A 90-second dramatic prelude to the song rather mirrors the
    characters from "Rebel." The video was directed by Stefan
    WÃ¼rnitzer, and produced by Karen Rohrbacher for Lucasfilm
    Commercial Productions.</p>
      <p>"Rush Rush" debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at #36 on May
    11, 1991, and hit #1 five weeks later, June 15, 1991, where it
    remained for five consecutive weeks. At the time of its
    five-week stint, it was the longest running #1 since Madonna's
    "Like a Virgin" spent six weeks at #1 during the winter of
    1984-1985. The song also spent five weeks atop the U.S. adult
    contemporary chart. It peaked at #6 on the UK Singles
    Chart.</p>
