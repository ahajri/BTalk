      <p>"Love Child" is a 1968 hit single released by the Motown
    label as a single for Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes, although
    Diana Ross is the only member of the group present on the
    recorded release; it is the group's 11th number one song in
    America.</p>
      <p>The number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart for
    four weeks, from November 24, 1968, to December 27, 1968 and
    reaching number two on the soul chart for three weeks, the song
    is notable for its then controversial subject matter of
    illegitimacy. It is also notable for knocking The Beatles'
    massive "Hey Jude" off the top spot in the United States, the
    last of five Beatles/Supremes replacements at number one on the
    US pop chart during the 1960s. The Supremes debuted the song on
    the season premiere of the CBS variety program 
    <i>The Ed Sullivan Show</i>on Sunday, September 29, 1968.</p>
      <p>In 1967, Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes, having dropped
    Florence Ballard, acquired new member Cindy Birdsong, and added
    Ross' name to the billing. Following this string of changes,
    the Supremes had mixed success on the pop charts. "Reflections"
    peaked at number 2 on the Billboard pop charts and "In and out
    of Love" peaked at 9, but the group's next two singles did not
    make the pop top twenty. Motown label chief Berry Gordy held a
    special meeting in a room at the Pontchartrain Hotel in
    Detroit, which was attended by a team of writers and producers
    at the label, including R. Dean Taylor, Frank Wilson, Pam
    Sawyer, Deke Richards, and Henry Cosby.</p>
      <p>The group, who named themselves The Clan, set to work on a
    hit single for Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes. Instead of
    composing another love-based song, the team decided to craft a
    tune about a woman who is asking her boyfriend not to pressure
    her into sleeping with him, for fear they would conceive a
    "love child." The woman, portrayed on the record by Diana Ross,
    is herself a love child, and, besides not having a father at
    home, had to endure wearing rags to school and growing up in an
    "old, cold, run-down tenement slum." The background vocals echo
    this sentiment, asking the boyfriend to please "wait/wait won't
    you wait now/hold on/wait/just a little bit longer.</p>
      <p>As was often the case with many of the records released
    under the "Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes" name, Supremes Mary
    Wilson and Cindy Birdsong do not appear on the record. Motown
    session singers The Andantes perform the background vocals,
    with all lead vocals by Diana Ross, who would leave the group
    in a year for a solo career.</p>
      <p>The resulting track had a decidedly different feel than
    previous Supremes singles, not only because of its
    change-of-pace subject matter, but also because of The Clan's
    production, which gave the melodramatic tale a driving, almost
    hedonistic rhythm.</p>
      <p>The public responded immediately to "Love Child" when it was
    released as a single on September 30, 1968; the song rose to
    number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and outsold all of the
    group's previous or subsequent 45 releases. In the UK singles
    chart, the song peaked at no. 15. "Love Child" became the title
    track of Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes' 
    <i>Love Child</i>album, released on November 13, 1968.</p>
      <p>The song was covered by Sweet Sensation as a major pop hit,
    and later by the rock group Broadzilla, as well as Canadian pop
    group One 2 One. Janet Jackson sampled "Love Child" in her 1994
    single "You Want This".</p>
