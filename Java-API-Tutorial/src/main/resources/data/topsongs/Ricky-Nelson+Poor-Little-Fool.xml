      <p>"Poor Little Fool" is a pop/rock song written by Sharon
    Sheeley. It was based on her disappointment following a
    short-lived relationship with a member of a popular singing
    duo. The best-known version of the song was recorded by Ricky
    Nelson on April 17, 1958, and released on Imperial Records
    5528. It holds the distinction of being the first number-one
    song on magazine's then newly-created Hot 100 chart, replacing
    the magazine's Top 100 and Best Sellers chart. It spent two
    weeks at the number-one spot. The record also reached the top
    ten on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Country and Rhythm and Blues charts.</p>
      <p>"Poor Little Fool" became a radio hit when it was released
    as part of a four-song Extended Play 45 rpm disc, which was
    excerpted from the artist's second LP, 
    <i>Ricky Nelson</i>. Responding to the buzz, Lew Chudd of
    Imperial Records rushed out a single version (on both 45 and 78
    rpm). Nelson objected, however, believing that the move would
    hurt sales of the EP. Under his contract with Imperial, the
    singer had approval rights for all picture-sleeve art, and, to
    express his displeasure with Chudd's decision, he chose not to
    select a photograph for the "Poor Little Fool" single. As a
    result, "Poor Little Fool" was the only Ricky Nelson single
    released by Imperial to be issued in the United States without
    a photo in a plain label-cut-out sleeve.</p>
