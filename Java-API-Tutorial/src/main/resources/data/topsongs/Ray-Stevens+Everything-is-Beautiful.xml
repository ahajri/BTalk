      <p>"Everything is Beautiful" is a song by Ray Stevens. It has
    appeared on many of Stevens' albums, including one named after
    the song, and has become a pop standard and common in religious
    performances. The children heard singing the chorus of the
    song, using the hymn, "Jesus Loves the Little Children", are
    from the Oak Hill Elementary School in Nashville, Tennessee.
    This group includes Stevens' two daughters. The singer arranged
    and tape recorded the impromptu session himself for inclusion
    in the song .</p>
      <p>The song was responsible for two wins at the Grammy Awards
    of 1971: Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for
    Ray Stevens and Grammy Award for Best Inspirational Performance
    for Jake Hess. Ray Stevens' recording was the number one song
    on the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks in the spring of 1970.
    The song also spent three weeks atop the adult contemporary
    chart. Many country stations played the song, peaking it at #39
    on Billboard's chart .</p>
      <p>This song was a major departure for Stevens, as "Everything
    is Beautiful" is a more serious and spiritual tune, unlike some
    of his earlier ("Gitarzan" and "Ahab the Arab") and later ("The
    Streak") recordings which were more in the style of
    comedy/novelty songs .</p>
      <p>The Smashing Pumpkins also released a cover of the song in
    their Live Smashing Pumpkins album series.</p>
