      <p>"I'm Your Baby Tonight" is the lead single and title track
    off Whitney Houston's third studio album of the same name. The
    song was produced by L.A. Reid and Babyface.</p>
      <p>***The single "Feels So Good" is a B-side/Bonus Cut...It has
    not been featured on any Whitney Houston album.</p>
      <p>The music video (directed by Julian Temple) features an
    edgier, rougher Houston (much different than she was in videos
    such as "How Will I Know" and "I Wanna Dance with Somebody")
    paying homage to the sounds of black music that have helped
    define her sound, paying tribute in simulation of the Harlem
    Renaissance (with Houston as Marlene Dietrich), Motown (most
    notably The Supremes as Houston uses cloning imagery to create
    two clones of herself), and Hollywood's Golden Age (with
    Houston dressed as Audrey Hepburn in 
    <i>Funny Face</i>), finally returning to present day by the
    video's end.</p>
      <p>After having charted ten Top 10 hits (and seven consecutive
    number ones) on the Billboard Hot 100, Houston continued her
    chart momentum as "I'm Your Baby Tonight" would become her
    eleventh Top 10 hit and eighth number one. The song had an
    impressive debut at number 42 the week of October 20, 1990. Six
    weeks later, it hit number one, ending Mariah Carey's
    three-week run at the top with "Love Takes Time". "I'm Your
    Baby Tonight" spent only one week at number one, being knocked
    out by Stevie B's "Because I Love You (The Postman Song)".
    Altogether, the single spent seven weeks in the Top 10, twelve
    weeks in the Top 20, and fourteen consecutive weeks in the Top
    40. It also reached number one on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>R&amp;B singles chart for two weeks. The single
    was certified Gold by the RIAA.</p>
      <p>"I'm Your Baby Tonight":</p>
      <p>"I'm Your Baby Tonight" hit the Top 10 in several major
    markets including Australia (#7), France (#4),Italy (#2),
    Switzerland (#4), UK (#5), and Germany (#5).</p>
