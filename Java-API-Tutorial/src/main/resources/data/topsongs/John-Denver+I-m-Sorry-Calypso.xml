      <p>"I'm Sorry" is a song written and recorded by American
    country-folk singer-songwriter John Denver. Released in 1975,
    it was his final number-one hit released during his career.</p>
      <p>The song, an apology for forsaken love, first reached number
    one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in September 1975. Six weeks
    later, it topped the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot Country Singles chart. "I'm Sorry" also
    reached number one on the easy listening chart that same
    year.</p>
      <p>The flip side of "I'm Sorry" was "Calypso", and like its
    A-side, it enjoyed substantial radio airplay on Top 40
    stations.</p>
