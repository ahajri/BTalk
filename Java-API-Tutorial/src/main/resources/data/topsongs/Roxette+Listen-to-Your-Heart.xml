   <descr>
      <p>"Listen to Your Heart" was the third single issued in the
    United States from Swedish pop duo Roxette's 1988 album 
    <i>Look Sharp!</i>It was written by Per Gessle and Mats M.P.
    Persson. It reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart
    on November 4, 1989, their second chart-topper of the year.
    They rose to #1 the same week the dominant New Kids on the
    Block rose to #2 with their song "Cover Girl", thus preventing
    the group from taking the top spot. The song was released in
    the UK in October 1989 and reached a lowly #62, but was
    re-issued in August 1990 as a Double A-Side with "Dangerous"
    after the success of their previous single "It Must Have Been
    Love", and reached #6.</p>
      <p>According to Gessle the song was conceived as :-</p>
      <p>"
    <i>The Big Bad Ballad. This is us trying to recreate that
    overblown American FM-rock sound to the point where it almost
    becomes absurd. We really wanted to see how far we could take
    it."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Two different versions of the song are available: the
    original, a and slightly modified version that was included on 
    <i>Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus</i>.</p>
      <p>Roxette recorded the video for "Listen to Your Heart" in the
    Borgholm Castle ruin on the Swedish Baltic Sea island of
    Öland.</p>
      <p>In 2008, the song had reached it four million American radio
    plays. The D.H.T. dance cover is included in the total of
    plays. The song has been voted The Best Roxette Song ever by
    readers of fan-site The Daily Roxette.</p>
      <p>At the Wembley Arena gig on their 1991-92 
    <i>Join The Joyride</i>/ 
    <i>The Summer Joyride</i>World Tour, before playing this song
    as part of the encore, Per said "We can't leave you tonight
    without playing you this absolutely true story."</p>
      <p>"Listen to Your Heart" / "Dangerous"</p>
      <p>In 2005, Belgian dance group D.H.T.'s trance-cover of
    "Listen to Your Heart" became a worldwide club hit. Originally
    released in Belgium in 2003, the various mixes of the song
    reached U.S. clubs in late 2004. The song was released in the
    U.S. in late 2005 or early 2006. By June 2005, the song reached
    number one on Hot Dance Airplay chart and the Top 10 of the Hot
    100 chart, peaking at #8 in August. The same year, the group
    also released an acoustic ballad version of the song, which
    also received substantial airplay.</p>
