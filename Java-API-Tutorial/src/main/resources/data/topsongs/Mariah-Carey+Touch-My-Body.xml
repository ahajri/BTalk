    pop." Bill Lamb from About.com also gave "Touch My Body" a

    <i>Slant Magazine'</i>s Sal Cinquemani said that the single
    "isn't exactly filled with combustible energy and it lacks the
    full-throttle belting that accompanied the Return of the Voice
    three years ago, but it features all of the characteristics one
    expects from a latter-day Mariah track." Rolling Stone gave it
    3.5 stars in its March 6, 2008 issue, as they felt that "this
    hyperdirty single [has] Mariah's storied vocal range...blunted
    in favor of generic, highly digitized heavy breathing, [but it
    is] a spare, slick track composed mostly of synths and finger
    snaps."</p>

    AllHipHop.com, Ratner said, "Mariah is musically at the top of
    her game and has never looked better... This will be our 6th
    music video we have collaborated on and definitely the best one
    yet visually, as well as musically. The video for "Touch My
    Body" is the perfect combination of fantasy and comedy with
    Mariah looking more beautiful than she has ever looked, ever."

    stars Jack McBrayer from 
    <i>30 Rock</i>, a show that Carey is a fan of. Carey appeared
