      <p>"(Ghost) Riders in the Sky: A Cowboy Legend" is a country
    and cowboy-style song. It was written on June 5, 1948 by Stan
    Jones.. A number of versions were crossover hits on the pop
    charts in 1949. The ASCAP database lists the song as "Riders in
    the Sky" (title code: 480028324), but the title has been
    written as "Ghost Riders", "Ghost Riders in the Sky", and "A
    Cowboy Legend".</p>
      <p>The song tells of a cowboy who has a vision of red-eyed,
    steel-hooved cattle thundering across the sky, being chased by
    the spirits of damned cowboys. One warns him that if he does
    not change his ways, he will be doomed to join them, forever
    "trying to catch the Devil's herd across these endless skies".
    Jones said that he had been told the story when he was 12 years
    old by an old cowboy friend. The story resembles the northern
    European mythic Wild Hunt.</p>
      <p>More than 50 performers have recorded versions of the song.
    Charting versions were recorded by Vaughn Monroe ("Riders in
    the Sky" with orchestra and vocal quartet), by Bing Crosby
    (with the Ken Darby Singers), Frankie Laine, Marty Robbins, and
    Johnny Cash. Other recordings were made by Peggy Lee (with the
    Jud Conlon Singers) and Spike Jones and his City Slickers. Gene
    Autry sang it in the 1949 movie, 
    <i>Riders in the Sky</i>. Children of Bodom, Impaled Nazarene
    and Die Apokalyptischen Reiter have also made covers.</p>
      <p>According to Robby Krieger, it inspired the classic Doors
    song "Riders on the Storm." The Doors also covered Ghost Riders
    in the Sky.</p>
      <p>The song was also the inspiration for the Marvel Comics
    character "Ghost Rider."</p>
      <p>The chorus lines of this song are and have been since the
    1960's a terrace song of the Aston Villa Football Club of
    England. The words have been modified to include the line "
    <i>Holte Enders in the Sky</i>" a reference to the occupants of
    the vast stand behind the goal at the southern end of the Villa
    Park stadium.</p>
      <p>Recordings have also been made by Mary McCaslin, The Tubes
    (masquerading as "Cowboy Fee &amp; The Heifer's Dream"), Marty
    Robbins, Dean Martin, Boston Pops, Lawrence Welk, R.E.M., Dixie
    Chicks, Kaleidoscope, The Doors, ( Guy Vanderhoof), and the
    British gothic rock band Scary Bitches. There is a German
    language version of the song called "Geisterreiter" which as
    early as 1949 was recorded by east german entertainer Rita Paul
    &amp; ther Cornel-Trio. Same year the version was released by
    Gerhard Wendland. More than 20 versions of the German version
    are known. Most notably by Howard Carpendale and Karel Gott.
    There is a cover by the surf-punk-electro-band Mikrowelle as
    well as in 2008 by German TV-entertainer Götz Alsmann feat.
    Bela B (from Die Ärzte).</p>
