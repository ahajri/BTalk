      <p>"Make Love to Me" may refer to one of two different
    songs.</p>
      <p>With music by Paul Mann and Stephan Weiss, and lyrics by Kim
    Gannon, it was recorded in 1942 by Helen Forrest with the Harry
    James Orchestra. It has also been performed by Ella Fitzgerald
    and Julie London.</p>
      <p>A 1954 popular song with words and music written by a larger
    team than normally is known to collaborate on a song: Bill
    Norvas, Alan Copeland, and the New Orleans Rhythm Kings,
    comprising Leon Rappolo, Paul Mares, Ben Pollack, George
    Brunies, Mel Stitzel, and Walter Melrose. The melody was
    derived from a 1923 song, "Tin Roof Blues", composed by the New
    Orleans Rhythm Kings.</p>
      <p>The best-known version of the song was recorded by Jo
    Stafford on December 8, 1953 (released by Columbia Records as
    catalog number 40143, with the flip side "Adi-Adios Amigo",)
    and in 1954 the #1 position on the Billboard chart went back
    and forth between this record and Doris Day's "Secret Love"
    (See 1954 in music#US No. 1 hit singles). On Cash Box
    magazine's charts, however, the song only reached #2. The same
    year, the song was covered in the United Kingdom by Alma Cogan
    and Billie Anthony.</p>
      <p>The recording by Alma Cogan was released in 1954 by HMV as
    catalog number 7M 196. The flip side was "Said the Little
    Moment".</p>
      <p>Other covers were recorded by:</p>
      <p>The song was also included on Anne Murray's
    tribute-to-the-fifties album, 
    <i>Croonin'</i>.</p>
