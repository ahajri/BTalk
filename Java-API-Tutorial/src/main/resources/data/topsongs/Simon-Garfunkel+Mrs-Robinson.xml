      <p>"Mrs. Robinson" is a song written by Paul Simon and first
    performed by Simon and Garfunkel. When released as a single in
    1968, it hit number one on the Hot 100 chart in the US, for
    their second chart-topping hit after "The Sounds of Silence".
    An early version of the song appeared in the motion picture 
    <i>The Graduate</i>(1967) and its subsequent soundtrack, while
    the complete song debuted on their album 
    <i>Bookends</i>(1968). The song earned the duo a Grammy Award
    for Record of the Year in 1969. Top session drummer Hal Blaine
    played on this. He considers it one of his favorites.</p>
      <p>In the film 
    <i>The Graduate</i>, listless recent college graduate Benjamin
    Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) has an affair with an older married
    woman, Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft). The song as it appears in
    the film is different from the familiar hit single version, as
    only the chorus of the song appears multiple times throughout
    the second half of the film. It was only later on that Paul
    Simon and Art Garfunkel re-recorded the song by employing
    additional lyrics to form the hit single.</p>
      <p>According to a 
    <i>Variety</i>article by Peter Bart in the May 15, 2005 issue ,
    director Mike Nichols had become obsessed with Simon &amp;
    Garfunkel's music while shooting the film. Larry Turman, his
    producer, made a deal for Simon to write three new songs for
    the movie. By the time they were nearly finished editing the
    film, Simon had only written one new song. Nichols begged him
    for more but Simon, who was touring constantly, told him he
    didn't have the time. He did play him a few notes of a new song
    he had been working on; "It's not for the movie... it's a song
    about times past — about Mrs. Roosevelt and Joe DiMaggio and
    stuff." Nichols advised Simon, "It's now about Mrs. Robinson,
    not Mrs. Roosevelt."</p>
      <p>The film 
    <i>Rumor Has It...</i>is based on the assumption that 
    <i>The Graduate</i>is based on real events which become
    uncovered. The song "Mrs. Robinson" is featured in this film as
    well. Much of the last 20 minutes of 
    <i>Wayne's World 2</i>parodies the final sequence of 
    <i>The Graduate</i>, and the version of "Mrs. Robinson" from
    the film is heard multiple times in a similar scene in which
    Wayne rushes to get to a wedding. One line from the film
    version is also heard near the end of the film 
    <i>American Pie</i>when Stifler's mother seduces the young
    character Finch. The song also is used in the films 
    <i>Forrest Gump</i>, 
    <i>My Mom's New Boyfriend</i>, 
    <i>The Holiday</i>and 
    <i>The Other Sister</i>.</p>
      <p>In early January 2010, after news of Iris Robinson (wife of
    Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson) having an
    extramarital affair with the adult child of a family friend
    became public, a group was set up on Facebook attempting to get
    the song "Mrs. Robinson" to No.1 in the Official UK Singles
    Chart for that week via download sales. It received coverage in
    
    <i>The Telegraph</i>and other British media. It also received
    coverage in gay-related publications because of the anti-gay
    stand of Peter Robinson.</p>
      <p>These lines in the last verse about Joe DiMaggio</p>
      <p>– are perhaps the most discussed. Paul Simon, a fan of
    Mickey Mantle, was asked during an intermission on 
    <i>The Dick Cavett Show</i>why Mantle wasn’t mentioned in the
    song instead of DiMaggio. Simon replied, "It's about syllables,
    Dick. It's about how many beats there are." For himself,
    DiMaggio initially complained that he had not gone anywhere,
    but soon dropped his complaints after a cordial meeting with
    Paul Simon when he explained what the lines meant. In a 
    <i>New York Times</i>op-ed in March 1999, shortly after
    DiMaggio's death, Simon discussed this meeting and explained
    that the line was meant as a sincere tribute to DiMaggio's
    unpretentious heroic stature, in a time when popular culture
    magnifies and distorts how we perceive our heroes. He further
    reflected: "In these days of Presidential transgressions and
    apologies and prime-time interviews about private sexual
    matters, we grieve for Joe DiMaggio and mourn the loss of his
    grace and dignity, his fierce sense of privacy, his fidelity to
    the memory of his wife and the power of his silence." Simon
    subsequently performed "Mrs. Robinson" at Yankee Stadium in
    DiMaggio's honor in April of the same year.</p>
