      <p>"Where Did Our Love Go" is a 1964 hit song recorded by The
    Supremes for the Motown label. Written and produced by Motown's
    main production team Holland–Dozier–Holland, "Where Did Our
    Love Go" was the first single by the Supremes to go to the
    number-one position on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, a
    position it held for two weeks, from August 16 to August 29,
    1964. It was also the first of five Supremes songs in a row to
    reach number one (respectively, "Baby Love," "Come See About
    Me," "Stop! In the Name of Love," and "Back in My Arms Again").
    The song also reached number one on the 
    <i>Cash Box</i>R&amp;B singles chart.</p>
      <p>This version was ranked #472 on 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>'s list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All
    Time.</p>
      <p>Holland–Dozier–Holland had originally composed the song and
    prepared the instrumental track for The Marvelettes to record
    it. The Marvelettes rejected the song, thinking it childish,
    and H–D–H offered it to the Supremes, who by early 1964 had
    only one top-forty hit, When the Lovelight Starts Shining
    Through His Eyes, and eight failed singles. Although the
    Supremes were apprehensive at first about the song, they
    decided that they really didn't have a choice in the
    matter.</p>
      <p>Upon learning the Supremes had chosen to record "Where Did
    Our Love Go", the Marvelettes warned the girls to stand up for
    themselves and not just take anything H–D–H would give them. As
    a result, when the song was recorded on April 8, 1964, there
    was a bit of animosity on the part of the Supremes towards
    singing the song. Lamont Dozier was forced at one point to redo
    the arrangement of the background vocals, replacing the
    original, more complex backing with simple repetitions of the
    word "baby".</p>
      <p>One of the most famous aspects of "Where Did Our Love Go"
    was its rhythm section, comprised primarily of footstomps. The
    sound effect was performed by an Italian-American teenager
    named Mike Valvano, who stomped down upon two wooden boards
    suspended by strings, to create the aural illusion of a group
    of foot-stompers. Handclaps were overdubbed for the 45 RPM
    single mix of the song.</p>
      <p>Since the lead vocal was originally written to be sung by
    the Marvelettes' lead singer Gladys Horton, it was arranged in
    lower key than the Supremes' lead singer Diana Ross' natural
    register. Lyricist Eddie Holland wanted Supreme Mary Wilson to
    sing the lead, feeling that her dusky voice suited the song
    better, but by this time Motown chief Berry Gordy had appointed
    Ross as the trio's sole lead singer. The resulting vocal track
    had a sensual appeal not present in Ross' earlier songs, and
    she elatedly rushed to Gordy's office, and dragged him to the
    basement studio at Hitsville U.S.A. to hear it. Upon hearing
    the finished song, Gordy remarked that the song had potential,
    possibly enough to make it to the top ten.</p>
      <p>"Where Did Our Love Go" was released as a single on June 17,
    1964, and entered the Hot 100 at number seventy-seven. Six
    weeks later, while the Supremes were on tour as part of Dick
    Clark's "American Bandstand Caravan of Stars", the song made it
    to number one for two weeks. The girls began the tour at the
    bottom of the bill; by the conclusion of the tour, they were at
    the top. They performed the song on the NBC variety program, 
    <i>Hullabaloo!</i>on Tuesday, January 26, 1965.</p>
      <p>The song became the focal point and title track of the
    group's second album, 
    <i>Where Did Our Love Go</i>, released later that year. A
    German language version of the song was recorded by the
    Supremes for German-speaking markets overseas.</p>
      <p>The song seemed to strike a chord in the USA as, while on
    one level it can be seen as a simple tale of a failed
    relationship, it can also been as capturing the spirit of the
    time after the assassination of JFK, racial tension, deepening
    problems in Vietnam and foreseeing the end of the early
    optimism of the 1960s.</p>
      <p>While not exactly a true cover, the melodic and chordal
    progressions of labelmates the Four Tops' "I Can't Help Myself
    (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)" are very similar to those of "Where
    Did Our Love Go". "I Can't Help Myself" reached number one in
    1965.</p>
