      <p>"Can't Fight This Feeling" is a number-one power ballad from
    REO Speedwagon about a man falling in love with a girl with
    whom he has been a friend for a long time.</p>
      <p>The song first appeared on REO Speedwagon's 1984 album 
    <i>Wheels Are Turnin'</i>. It was the group's second number-one
    hit on the U.S. charts (the first being 1981's "Keep on Loving
    You", also written by Kevin Cronin) and reached number sixteen
    in the UK. "Can't Fight This Feeling" has appeared on dozens of
    'various artists' compilation albums, as well as several REO
    Speedwagon greatest hits albums. It has also been featured on
    soundtracks of movies such as 
    <i>Not Another Teen Movie</i>, 
    <i>Waiting...</i>, and, most recently, 
    <i>Kickin' It Old Skool</i>and 
    <i>Sex Drive</i>. The song was also heard on the 
    <i>South Park</i>episode "Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy", the 
    <i>Fringe</i>episode "Power Hungry" as well as in the Showtime
    hit series 
    <i>Queer as Folk</i>. REO Speedwagon performed the song at the
    1985 Live Aid concert and it was sung at the end of 
    <i>Horton Hears a Who!</i>.</p>
      <p>It was referred to again recently in The CW show 
    <i>Supernatural</i>(in the second season episode #5, "Simon
    Said", Jo Harvelle turns this song on for Dean Winchester in
    Harvelle's Roadhouse, later he sings it in the car claiming the
    song had stuck in his head). It was also featured prominently
    in advertising for the film 
    <i>Horton Hears a Who!</i>, and sung by the major characters
    near the end of the movie as the titular character celebrates
    his vindication and his charges' salvation. It was also used in
    a Valentine's Day 2009 commercial for Hallmark Cards, and was
    sung in the hit show . It was again featured in an early
    episode of King of the Hill when Dale marries Nancy.</p>
      <p>Two different music videos exist for the song. One is a
    basic video, appearing almost homemade, featuring the band in
    the studio. It begins with Kevin Cronin playing the piano,
    attempting to find the key in which he can best sing the song
    (starting off in G major, he later decides he can sing it
    better in A). After Cronin exchanges some laughs with his
    bandmates, the song officially begins; the video essentially
    consists of the band members lip-synching to the original track
    of the song. It then concludes with Cronin uttering the
    memorable line, "That warmed the cockles of my cockles!" The
    other version of the video is much more "professional," and
    makes various references to the life-cycle. Both videos have
    been shown at various times on VH1 Classic.</p>
