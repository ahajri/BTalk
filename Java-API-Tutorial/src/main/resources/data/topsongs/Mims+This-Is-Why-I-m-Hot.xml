      <p>"This Is Why I'm Hot" is a song by American rapper Mims. The
    song was co-written by Mims and produced by Blackout Movement
    for his debut album 
    <i>Music Is My Savior</i>(2007).</p>
      <p>Released in 2007 as the first single from the album, the
    song reached #1 on the U.S. Hot 100 chart, as well as #2 on the
    Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and #1 on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot Rap Tracks chart, eventually being
    certified Platinum by the RIAA.</p>
      <p>The song debuted at number one on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot Digital Songs chart, selling 140,874
    downloads. It remained the top-selling digital single for one
    additional week.</p>
      <p>Eventually, the success of the song in the United States saw
    a release in the United Kingdom in May 2007, where the single
    reached a peak of #18 on the UK Singles Chart on the week dated
    June 3, 2007.</p>
      <p>The song features samples of various hip-hop songs,
    including Kanye West's "Jesus Walks", E-40's "Tell Me When to
    Go", Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg's "Nuthin' But a "G" Thang" and
    Mobb Deep's "Shook Ones Part II". Each sampled song is played
    when Mims mentions the area from which each artist
    originated.</p>
      <p>The song received mostly positive to mixed reviews by
    critics.</p>
      <p>William Ketchum III of About stated about Mims is "striving
    to "bring New York back" like his peers" on the song. He
    continued to comment about the song's chart success, stating:
    "With "This Is Why I'm Hot" continuing to burn up the charts,
    he's proven what he's got, but let's see if he can stay on
    top." The song received a three out of five star rating from
    the site.</p>
      <p>On their review of the album 
    <i>Music Is My Savior</i>, Allmusic stated that "the
    deceptively simple "This Is Why I'm Hot" demonstrates this
    well. MIMS raps about his nationwide appeal over hyphy-esque
    production that alludes to other influential MCs." The track
    was listed as an "AMG track pick" on the review page.</p>
      <p>On his review of 
    <i>Music Is My Savior</i>, Christian Hoard of 
    <i>Rolling Stone</i>described the song as "a catchy little
    thing with a cool, minimalist beat and some goofy charm."</p>
      <p>The official remix, entitled the "Blackout Remix", which is
    the only reggae fusion version of the song, features dancehall
    artist Cham and reggae singer Junior Reid. This version is
    featured on 
    <i>Music Is My Savior</i>.</p>
      <p>There is also a reggaeton remix of the song, entitled "Por
    Eso Estoy Pegao", which features rapper Daddy Yankee. Another
    reggaeton remix, based on the Blackout Remix, featured Tego
    Calder√≥n and Calle 13.</p>
      <p>Rapper Twista made a song entitled "This Is Why I'm
    Cold".</p>
      <p>Rapper Lil Wayne performed a freestyle over the beat as an
    intro for Da Drought 3</p>
      <p>Rapper Talib Kweli made a remix entitled "Niggas Lie a
    Lot".</p>
      <p>By early March 2007, the online release of the song had
    propelled it from number 32 to number one on the Hot 100 in one
    week; this was then the third-greatest rise to number one in
    the history of the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot 100. It remained at number one the next
    week until it was surpassed by "Glamorous", by Fergie and
    Ludacris the week after in the issue dated March 24, 2007.</p>
