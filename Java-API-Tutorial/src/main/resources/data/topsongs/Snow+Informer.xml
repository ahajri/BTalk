      <p>"Informer" is a 1992 single by Canadian reggae musician
    Snow, featuring MC Shan as guest artist and producer, from his
    debut album 
    <i>12 Inches of Snow</i>. The single was released shortly
    before Snow was imprisoned for a year on an assault charge.
    Upon his release from prison, it became a chart topping hit,
    spending seven consecutive weeks at Number 1 on the 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot 100. It was his biggest hit in the UK,
    where it reached Number 2, behind two different number one
    singles.</p>
      <p>"Informer" is a slang term, usually derogatory, for a police
    informant, who is protected in exchange for information used to
    solve cases. Another term for it would be snitch.</p>
      <p>"Informer" won a Juno Award for Best Reggae Recording in
    1994. It reached 40th on MuchMoreMusic's list of the top "50
    Guilty Pleasures" and was 84th on VH1's "100 Greatest Songs of
    the '90s." It also reached 28th on VH1's "Final Countdown
    Greatest Hip-Hop of All Time".</p>
