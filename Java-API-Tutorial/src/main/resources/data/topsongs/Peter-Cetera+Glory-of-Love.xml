      <p>"Glory of Love" is a popular song written by Peter Cetera,
    David Foster and Cetera's wife at the time, Diane Nini, and
    recorded by Cetera shortly after he left the band Chicago to
    pursue a solo career. The song was Cetera's first hit single
    and was included on his 1986 album, 
    <i>Solitude/Solitaire</i>.</p>
      <p>The song was originally recorded for inclusion in the
    soundtrack for 
    <i>Rocky IV</i>, but was passed up. It was instead added to the
    soundtrack for the film 
    <i>The Karate Kid, Part II</i>.</p>
      <p>The single peaked at number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot
    100 chart on August 2, 1986, remaining in that spot for two
    weeks. It also spent five weeks atop the U.S. adult
    contemporary chart. The song achieved similar success in the
    UK, peaking at number three on the UK Singles Chart, where it
    was the 26th best-selling single of 1986.</p>
      <p>The version of the song as released as a single and on
    Cetera's album 
    <i>Solitude/Solitare</i>is edited, missing the beginning
    eight-second section of the song's bridge (which is heard in
    the actual 
    <i>Karate Kid II</i>film).</p>
      <p>The song earned nominations in 1987 for an Academy Award for
    Best Song and a Golden Globe in the category of Best Original
    Song. It was also nominated for a Grammy Award in 1987 for
    "Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Male Artist."</p>
      <p>It went on to win an ASCAP Award for "Most Performed Songs
    from Motion Pictures" and a BMI Film &amp; TV Award for "Most
    Performed Song from a Film."</p>
