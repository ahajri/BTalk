      <p>"The Way It Is" is a hit song by Bruce Hornsby and the Range
    from their 1986 album 
    <i>The Way It Is</i>. It topped the Billboard Hot 100 in 1986.
    Written by Bruce Hornsby, it made explicit reference to the
    American Civil Rights Movement. This song was heavily sampled
    by Tupac Shakur in his song, "Changes".</p>
      <p>In the UK, a version of the tune is used as the theme song
    to the BBC 1 daytime program 
    <i>City Hospital</i>and a crudely edited 'loop' of the final
    instrumental section was also used as background music the
    BBC's sports programme 
    <i>Grandstand</i>in the late 1980s, where it was played while
    the presenter ran down the football league tables at the end of
    the programme. Indeed in the UK (where the song only reached
    no. 15 in the charts), the song was possibly more well-known
    for its regular appearances on 
    <i>Grandstand</i>than for its appearance in the charts. The
    song was also featured in Australia as the background theme of
    the Nine Network's weekend news sports wrap up as well as
    during AFL Football telecasts in the 1990s. In this case, the
    song was used as a background theme while other weekly match
    results appeared on screen.</p>
      <p>In the 1990s and 2000s, "The Way It Is" was used as the
    theme music for Sean Hannity's syndicated radio talk show.
    Hornsby, a progressive Democrat, has stated his disapproval of
    Hannity's politics and the usage of "The Way It Is."
    Afterwards, Hannity criticized Hornsby and has since stopped
    using "The Way It Is" as the main theme for his show.</p>
