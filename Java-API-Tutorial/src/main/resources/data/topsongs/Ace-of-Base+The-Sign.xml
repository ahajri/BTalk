      <p>"The Sign" is a 1993 dance-pop song by the Swedish band Ace
    of Base. The song was an international smash hit, spending six
    non-consecutive weeks as number one on the Billboard Hot 100
    chart in the United States, also reaching Number two in the
    United Kingdom. It was on an album called 
    <i>Happy Nation</i>in most of the world, but 
    <i>The Sign</i>in North America.</p>
      <p>The song was the #1 song of 1994 according to Billboard
    magazine's year-end charts. The song was ranked at #51 on 
    <i>The Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs</i>for the first 50
    years of the Hot 100 chart. The song has been covered by The
    Mountain Goats.</p>
      <p>The music video of the song features the pop group singing
    amidst romantic and frolic images; "The Sign" was depicted as
    an ankh and a djed. The music video is Directed By: Mathias
    Julin.</p>
      <p>Amid the images is a little story of a man and woman sitting
    side by side until the man leaves, seemingly abandoning the
    woman. However, he comes back with a rose and offers it to the
    woman. The woman graciously accepts and takes his hand.
    However, a bright light shines in the woman's face, drawing her
    away, abandoning the man and dropping the rose on the
    chair.</p>
