      <p>"You Keep Me Hangin' On" is a 1966 number-one hit song
    originally recorded by The Supremes for the Motown label.</p>
      <p>Musicians such as Wilson Pickett, Rod Stewart, Melanie
    Safka, The Box Tops, Gov't Mule, Colourbox, Madness, Glee and
    Dead On Arrival have all recorded versions of the song, but the
    three most successful remakes were recorded by the late-1960s
    rock band Vanilla Fudge, 1980s pop singer Kim Wilde, and 1990s
    country singer Reba McEntire.</p>
      <p>Written and produced by Motown's main production team
    Holland–Dozier–Holland (H-D-H), the single is very-much rooted
    in proto-funk and rhythm and blues, compared to the Supremes'
    previous single, "You Can't Hurry Love," which utilizes the
    call and response elements akin to gospel. The song's signature
    guitar bassline originated from a Morse code-like radio signal
    heard by Lamont Dozier, who collaborated with Brian and Eddie
    Holland to integrate the idea into single.</p>
      <p>Many elements of the recording, including the guitars, the
    drums, and Ross's vocals, were multitracked, a production
    technique which was established and popularized concurrently by
    H-D-H and other premier producers of the 1960s such as Phil
    Spector (see 
    <i>Wall of Sound</i>) and George Martin. H-D-H recorded the
    song in nine sessions with The Supremes and session band The
    Funk Brothers before settling on a version deemed suitable for
    the final release.</p>
      <p>Becoming The Supremes' eighth number-one single, "You Keep
    Me Hangin' On" topped the Billboard Hot 100 pop singles chart
    for two weeks in November 1966 and the magazine's soul chart
    for four weeks.. The track is one of the more oft-covered songs
    in the Supremes canon. They performed the song on the ABC
    variety program 
    <i>The Hollywood Palace</i>on Saturday, October 29, 1966.</p>
      <p>"You Keep Me Hangin' On" was the first single from the
    Supremes' 1967 album 
    <i>The Supremes Sing Holland–Dozier–Holland</i>. The original
    version was #339 on 
    <i>Rolling Stone'</i>s The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.</p>
      <p>Vanilla Fudge's 1967 psychedelic/hard rock remake of "You
    Keep Me Hangin' On" reached #6 on the Hot 100 chart two years
    after the release of the Supremes' recording. While the version
    released on 45 RPM single was under three minutes long, the
    album version was extended to six minutes and forty-five
    seconds. The recording, done in one take, was Vanilla Fudge's
    first single.</p>
      <p>"You Keep Me Hangin' On" was covered in an updated version
    by British singer Kim Wilde in 1986. It was released as the
    second single from Wilde's 
    <i>Another Step</i>album (although "You Keep Me Hangin' On" was
    the LP's first worldwide single, as the first single had been
    released only in selected countries).</p>
      <p>Wilde's version was a total re-working of the original,
    completely transforming the Supremes' Motown Sound into a 1980s
    power pop song. She and her brother, producer Ricki Wilde, had
    not heard "You Keep Me Hangin' On" for several years when they
    decided to record it. The song was not a track they knew well,
    so they treated it as a new song, even slightly changing the
    original lyrics. It became the biggest hit of Wilde's career,
    reaching #2 in her home country as well as hitting the top spot
    in Europe and Australia. It also became Wilde's only major hit
    in the US, spending a week at number one in 1987.</p>
      <p>Incidentally, since Wilde's recording was popular during the
    evolution of sample-based hip hop, a short drum break in her
    version has become one of the most sampled pieces of audio
    ever. In 2006, she performed a new version of the song with the
    German singer Nena for her 
    <i>Never Say Never</i>album.</p>
      <p>Country music singer Reba McEntire covered the song on her
    1996 album 
    <i>Starting Over</i>. Although not released to country radio,
    McEntire's rendition was her only dance hit, reaching #2 on Hot
    Dance Club Play.</p>
