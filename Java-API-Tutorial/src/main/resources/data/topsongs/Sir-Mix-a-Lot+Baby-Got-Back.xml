      <p>"Baby Got Back" is a 1992 hip hop song by Sir Mix-a-Lot from
    his album 
    <i>Mack Daddy</i>. The song memorably starts with a discussion
    between two thin, white valley girls, with one girl remarking
    to the other "Oh my God, Becky! Look at her butt! It is so big.
    She looks like one of those rap guys' girlfriends." At the time
    of its original release, the song caused controversy with its
    outspoken and blatantly sexual lyrics about the female anatomy,
    and the video was briefly banned by MTV. However, it has
    remained very popular over time. It samples Channel One's
    "Technicolor".</p>
      <p>In 2008, it was ranked number 17 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs
    of Hip Hop.</p>
      <p>Sir Mix-a-Lot's best known song, "Baby Got Back" reached
    number 1 on the United States' 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot 100 chart for five weeks in the summer of
    1992, and won a 1993 Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo
    Performance. It is known to be a fairly common song over a
    decade later in many movies, shows, music videos, even
    commercials. It was placed at number 6 on Vh1's Greatest Songs
    of the '90s.</p>
